COMM,"IN THE CURRENT SCENARIO, THE LEVEL OF INTEREST IS INCREASING IN FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE HANDICRAFT SECTOR WORLDWIDE. SO THE PRIMARY PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO DISCOVER THE DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTS THAT INFLUENCE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN INDIA AS LEARNER STUDENTS OR AFTER COMPLETION OF THEIR DEGREE, EITHER SKILL DEGREE OR PROFESSIONAL DEGREE. FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS AN IMPORTANT FEATURE OF ECONOMIC PROGRESS, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING NATIONS, SINCE IT PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES FOR INNOVATION, CULTURAL AND TRADITIONAL CONNECTIVITY, JOB CREATION, POVERTY REDUCTION, SOCIO-ECONOMIC GROWTH, ETC. HOWEVER, DESPITE ITS SIGNIFICANCE, THIS STUDY HAS GARNERED LITTLE ATTENTION IN THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP LITERATURE. FOR THIS RESEARCH, WE USED SURVEY RESEARCH AND CONVENIENCE SAMPLING. FOR DATA ANALYSIS, AMOS 25 SOFTWARE WAS USED; WHERE NEEDED, WE USED AN EXCEL SHEET FOR TABLE FORMATION. AT THE SAME TIME, TRADITIONAL CULTURAL CONSTRAINTS HAVE TENDED TO STUDY INDIAN WOMEN’S PARTICIPATION IN HANDICRAFT ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IT HAS BEEN SEEN THAT MOST INDIAN FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THEIR BUSINESSES. THESE FEMALES ARE ENGAGED IN BANKING, MANUFACTURING, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, ELECTRONIC, TEXTILE, AND SMALL INDUSTRIES. HOWEVER, THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT IS TRYING TO MOTIVATE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS IN THE HANDICRAFT INDUSTRY, BUT THERE IS LESS NUMBER OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THESE SECTORS DUE TO MANY FACTORS. JUST A HANDFUL HAS BENEFITED THROUGH INITIATIVE, ESPECIALLY IN THE HANDICRAFT INDUSTRY. FURTHERMORE, ONLY A FEW RESEARCH ARTICLES HAVE FOCUSED ON THE EFFECT OF ESSENTIAL ELEMENTS. THE RESEARCH PROVIDES AN ENTREPRENEURSHIP EVENT MODEL, A THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR, AND AN INTEGRATED MODEL OF THE THEORY, WHICH IS EVALUATED USING DATA FROM SOME INDIAN INSTITUTIONS FOCUSED ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP. © 2023, SPRINGER NATURE LIMITED.",NA,"M.A. TRIPATHI; MOTILAL NEHRU NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ALLAHABAD, PRAYAGRAJ, UTTAR PRADESH, INDIA; EMAIL: MANOASHISH@MNNIT.AC.IN",10.1057/s41599-023-01882-w,NA,NA,26629992,HUMANITIES AND SOCIAL SCIENCES COMMUNICATIONS,ENGLISH,0,1,NA,NA,FINAL,SPRINGER NATURE,SCOPUS,EVALUATION OF FACTORS AFFECTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP: A CASE OF INDIAN WOMEN IN THE HANDICRAFT INDUSTRY,ARTICLE,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85167453116&doi=10.1057%2fs41599-023-01882-w&partnerID=40&md5=fa0d5a84f23588e0d08cf29af17456ec,10,2023,HUM SOC SCI COMM,none,MOTILAL NEHRU NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ALLAHABAD,NOTREPORTED;MOTILAL NEHRU NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY ALLAHABAD;NOTREPORTED,NA,"YADAV US, 2023, HUM SOC SCI COMM","YADAV US, 2023, HUM SOC SCI COMM"

THE NATIONAL SAMPLE SURVEY (NSS) UNIT-LEVEL DATA ARE USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. THE DESCRIPTIVE RESULTS SHOW THAT WOMEN'S PROPRIETORSHIP IS MUCH LOWER THAN ITS COUNTERPART. THE PROBIT REGRESSION RESULTS AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL SHOW THAT WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS DO NOT HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT OR COMPUTER BUT USE THE INTERNET, ARE NOT REGISTERED UNDER ANY ACT OR AUTHORITY, AND DO NOT EXPAND CONSIDERABLY. THEY OPERATE WITHIN HOUSEHOLD PREMISES WITH A LIMITED NUMBER OF MONTHS AND DURATION OF A DAY, UNDERTAKING MAINLY CONTRACT BASIS. THEY ALSO FACE SEVERAL PROBLEMS THAT HINDER THEIR ACTIVITIES. CITY-LEVEL FACTORS SUCH AS WORK PARTICIPATION RATE, CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURE, HIGHER LEVELS OF GENERAL AND TECHNICAL DEGREES, AND VOCATIONAL TRAINING ARE ESSENTIAL. THE LIKELIHOOD OF BECOMING A FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR IS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE TWO AGGLOMERATION VARIABLES OF POPULATION SIZE AND PARTICIPATION IN MIXED ACTIVITY.

ONE OF THE IMPORTANT ASPECTS THAT STUDIES ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP MUST CONSIDER IS A GENDER APPROACH, FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE, THE RESEARCH AIMS TO IDENTIFY TRENDS IN RESEARCH ON FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RURAL AREAS BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF BIBLIOMETRIC STUDIES CONDUCTED IN THIS FIELD. A DEDUCTIVE, BIBLIOGRAPHIC, DESCRIPTIVE, AND CORRELATIONAL METHOD WAS USED, AND BIBLIOMETRICS WAS USED AS AN INSTRUMENT. THE DATA USED WERE RETRIEVED FROM THREE DATABASES: SCOPUS, WOS, GOOGLE SCHOLAR, TO IDENTIFY TYPES, SCOPE AND TRENDS OF RESEARCH AND PROVIDE RESEARCHERS WITH A SCIENTIFIC BASIS ON THE CURRENT SITUATION. A TOTAL OF 44 PAPERS WERE CONSIDERED AS POPULATION AND AFTER USING THE PRISMA METHOD AND EXCLUDING STUDIES NOT RELATED TO THE RESEARCH OBJECTIVE AND DUPLICATES WITH THE SCOPUS DATABASE, A TOTAL OF 30 ARTICLES WERE ANALYZED WHICH CONSTITUTE THE TOTAL SAMPLE. VOSVIEWER AND SPSS WERE USED FOR THE ANALYSIS. THE SEARCH FOR DOCUMENTS IN THE THREE DATABASES COVERED THE PERIOD FROM 1960 TO 2023. THE RESULTS SHOW, THEREFORE, THAT BIBLIOMETRIC RESEARCH ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS NOT YET ADDRESSED OTHER TOPICS BEYOND A GENERALIZATION OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SUCH AS STUDIES ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONSIDERING GENDER, RURAL GEOGRAPHIC SPACES, ICT, TRAINING, FINANCING, EFFECTS, CAUSES, SUCCESSES, AND FAILURES. THIS ALLOWS US TO DETECT THAT THERE IS AN AMPLE SCOPE FOR DEVELOPING RESEARCH NOT ONLY AT THE CASE LEVEL, BUT ALSO AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, BECAUSE FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE CASE OF ECUADOR WE WERE UNABLE TO IDENTIFY BIBLIOMETRIC STUDIES THAT ANALYSES THESE DIFFERENT ASPECTS WITH A GENDER FOCUS AND SPATIAL INTERVENTION OF THE RURAL SPHERE ON WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

THE CORONAVIRUS DISEASE 2019 (COVID-19) PANDEMIC REDUCED THE WORLD ECONOMY AND CAUSED ECONOMIC SHOCKS IN VARIOUS BUSINESS SECTORS. WOMEN SUCCESSORS FACE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN OVERCOMING FAMILY BUSINESS PROBLEMS DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, ESPECIALLY IN TERMS OF RESILIENCE, WHICH IS SEEN AS THE ORGANIZATION'S PROMINENT ABILITY FOR SUSTAINABILITY IN A TURBULENT ENVIRONMENT. THUS, THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S INITIATIVES AND PROPOSE A FRAMEWORK FOR FAMILY BUSINESS RESILIENCE DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC IN INDONESIA. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY USES A QUALITATIVE METHOD WITH A CASE STUDY APPROACH TO EXPLORE WOMEN'S INITIATIVES IN FAMILY BUSINESS RESILIENCE DURING THE COVID-19 PERIOD. DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH FIVE WOMEN'S SUCCESSORS OF FAMILY BUSINESSES IN INDONESIA. TRIANGULATION WAS USED TO TEST DATA VALIDITY. MEANWHILE, DATA ANALYSIS USES THE MILES–HUBERMAN TECHNIQUE: DATA REDUCTION, DATA DISPLAY AND CONCLUSION DRAWING/VERIFICATION. FINDINGS: THIS STUDY FOUND THAT WOMEN HAVE THE INITIATIVE TO DEAL WITH THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT RESILIENCE IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR FACTORS THAT ENHANCE FAMILY BUSINESS RESILIENCE, INCLUDING STRATEGIC DECISION-MAKING (ADAPTIVE CAPACITY, STRATEGY RENEWAL AND APPROPRIATION CAPACITY), STRATEGIC FACTORS (SUCCESSOR MOTIVATION, SUCCESSOR COMPETENCE AND FAMILY SUPPORT) AND SUCCESSOR INCREMENTAL PROGRAM. WOMEN HAVE A LONG-TERM ORIENTATION TOWARD THE SUSTAINABILITY OF THEIR FAMILY BUSINESSES AND CAN OVERCOME VARIOUS CONFLICTS. THE STEREOTYPICAL VIEW OF WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP IN FAMILY BUSINESSES HAS EXPERIENCED A SHIFT IN WHICH CAPABILITY AND COMPETENCE ARE THE MAIN FACTORS IN RECOGNIZING WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO UNDERSTANDING WOMEN'S ROLES IN THE RESILIENCE OF FAMILY BUSINESSES UNDER EXTREME STRESS DURING THE PANDEMIC. THIS STUDY PROPOSES A FRAMEWORK FOR FAMILY BUSINESS RESILIENCE.

IT FOCUSES ON EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF EE ON THE EI OF DIFFERENT GROUPS OF COLLEGE STUDENTS FROM THE PERSPECTIVES OF GENDER, HOUSEHOLD REGISTRATION, SCHOOL TYPE, AND POVERTY STATUS. BENCHMARK REGRESSION RESULTS SHOW THAT EE HAS A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE EI OF STUDENTS. THE HETEROGENEITY ANALYSIS HAS THE FOLLOWING FINDINGS. FIRST, EE HAS A MORE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WOMEN'S EI, WHICH CAN REDUCE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL GAP BETWEEN WOMEN AND MEN. SECOND, EE IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN IMPROVING THE EI OF URBAN STUDENTS, WHICH WILL FURTHER WIDEN THE GAP BETWEEN URBAN AND RURAL STUDENTS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THIRD, EE HAS INCREASED THE EI OF STUDENTS FROM PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES, WHICH REPRESENT APPLICATION-ORIENTED UNIVERSITIES. THIS SHOWS THAT PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES, WHICH REPRESENT RESEARCH-ORIENTED UNIVERSITIES, NEED TO INCREASE THE TRAINING OF TALENT IN PRACTICAL APPLICATIONS TO NARROW THE GAP WITH PRIVATE UNIVERSITIES IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FOURTH, AFTER RECEIVING EE, THE EI OF NONPOOR STUDENTS IMPROVED MORE THAN THAT OF POOR STUDENTS.

IN TUNISIA, THE NUMBER OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS OPERATING ON SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS SUCH AS FACEBOOK IS NOTEWORTHY. THUS, IN THIS STUDY IT IS AIMED TO DETERMINE THE FACTORS THAT PROMPTED WOMEN TO DEVELOP BUSINESSES ON FACEBOOK, AND HOW THIS SOCIAL NETWORK IS A VENUE FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. PARTICULAR ATTENTION IS PAID TO IDENTIFY INDIVIDUAL-RELATED (PUSH/PULL ENTREPRENEURIAL MOTIVATION), TECHNOLOGY-RELATED AND INSTITUTIONAL FACTORS THAT BEAR ON THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA. TO THIS END, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH A SAMPLE OF 24 FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS PROVIDE RELEVANT INFORMATION AND SUPPORT THE IDEA THAT SOCIAL MEDIA HAS OPENED UP NEW HORIZONS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR WOMEN TO PURSUE THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. PULL MOTIVATIONS ARE REALLY BEHIND THE DECISION TO START UP SOCIAL COMMERCE. FACEBOOK ADVANTAGEOUS FEATURES HAVE EMPOWERED WOMEN TO CREATE CUSTOMER NETWORKS, USED NATURE MARKETING TOOL AT NO COST AND ACQUIRE POSITIVE ATTITUDE TOWARDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FINALLY, ALTHOUGH THE INFORMAL NATURE OF BUSINESS ON FACEBOOK IS ATTRACTIVE, FORMALIZATION REMAINS A CHALLENGE FOR THE MAJORITY OF WOMEN.

AS RESEARCH EXAMINING THIS CRITICAL ROLE OF WOMEN IS SCANT, WE ATTEMPTED TO UNDERSTAND HOW WOMEN AS AGRO-ENTREPRENEURS CAN PROMOTE VEGETABLES TO ENHANCE HEALTHCARE SITUATIONS. A FIELD STUDY WAS CONDUCTED IN A NORTHEASTERN DISTRICT OF BANGLADESH FROM JANUARY TO JUNE 2019, ADOPTING QUALITATIVE–PARTICIPATORY APPROACHES THAT INVOLVED INTERVIEWS, FOCUS GROUPS, AND WORKSHOPS. THE STUDY REVEALED THAT WOMEN PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN TAKING CARE OF THE HEALTH OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS, WHILE THEIR ROLE IN PLANNING THE FAMILY DIET IS EXCLUSIVE. HOWEVER, THEY HAVE LIMITED DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY IN THE PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF VEGETABLES, AND THEIR KNOWLEDGE AND PERCEPTION OF NCDS ARE LIMITED. THE RESULTS IMPLY THAT WITH ENHANCED CAPACITY OF VEGETABLE PRODUCTION AND BETTER KNOWLEDGE OF NUTRITION AND NCDS, WOMEN CAN IMPROVE FAMILY DIETARY HABITS BY INCREASING THE CONSUMPTION OF VEGETABLES. THEREFORE, BUILDING THE AGRO-ENTREPRENEURIAL CAPACITIES OF WOMEN IN TERMS OF KNOWLEDGE, SKILLS, ACCESS TO FINANCE, AND DECISION-MAKING AUTHORITY AT THE FAMILY LEVEL WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INTERVENTIONAL APPROACH FOR INCREASED PRODUCTION AND CONSUMPTION OF VEGETABLES.

STARTUP EXIT IS MODELLED THROUGH CHOICE MODELS ON A SAMPLE OF 903 STARTUPS. COX PROPORTIONAL HAZARD REGRESSION WAS USED FOR THE ROBUSTNESS CHECK. THE RESULTS SUGGEST THAT VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING INCREASES THE PROBABILITY OF ACQUISITION. HOWEVER, THE NUMBER OF FUNDING ROUNDS REDUCED THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACQUISITION SIGNIFICANTLY INDICATING THAT REPEAT FUNDING HAS A POSITIVE IMPACT ON NEW VENTURE CONTINUITY. THERE IS A TRADE-OFF BETWEEN THE QUANTITY AND CONSISTENCY OF VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING IN AFFECTING THE LIKELIHOOD OF ACQUISITION.

THE ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT, TO OVERCOME THEIR SUPPOSED DEFICIENCIES, THE PARTICIPANTS UNDERSTOOD THAT FEMALE ENTREPRENEURIALISM REQUIRED UNLIMITED EFFORTS TO SELF-MODULATE THEIR EMOTIONAL DISPOSITIONS. THE ANALYSIS IDENTIFIED THREE BROAD CULTURAL NARRATIVES THAT FRAME ENTREPRENEURIALISM AS AN EPIC QUEST, A VOCATION OR CALLING, AND A LUDIC PURSUIT OF PLEASURE.

THE PROJECT AIMED AT FACILITATING THE INTEGRATION OF FEMALE REFUGEES INTO GERMAN SOCIETY BY WAY OF ‘EMPOWERING’ THEM TO BECOME SELF-EMPLOYED. A BUSINESS COUNSELING AGENCY WITH A FEMINIST ORIENTATION WAS COMMISSIONED TO DESIGN AND RUN THE PROJECT. INTERPELLATING REFUGEE WOMEN AS SUBJECTS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-ACTUALIZATION TO ENACT GENDER EQUALITY, THE PROJECT EMBODIES A TANGIBLE EXAMPLE OF POSTFEMINIST GOVERNMENTALITY. COMBINING RECENT RESEARCH ON POSTFEMINISM WITH ANALYTICS OF GOVERNMENTALITY, THE STUDY DIRECTS ITS ANALYTICAL GAZE TO THE WORK OF GOVERNING. THIS OPENS UP A TWOFOLD PERSPECTIVE: IT ENABLES US TO INVESTIGATE THE OPERATION OF GOVERNMENTAL POWER IN RELATION TO ITS ENVISIONED SUBJECTS, AND HOW THIS POWER ACTS UPON THE SUBJECTS TASKED WITH THE WORK OF GOVERNING IN THE CONTEMPORARY ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT. DRAWING ON QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS AND DOCUMENTARY MATERIALS WITHIN AN “ETHNOGRAPHIC IMAGINARY”, WE EXAMINE, FIRST, THE ASSEMBLAGE OF ELEMENTS THAT MADE UP THE FABRIC OF POSTFEMINIST GOVERNMENTALITY IN THE GOVERNMENTAL INTERVENTION AT HAND AND WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THE GOVERNMENTAL ATTEMPTS “HIT THE GROUND” MET—AND FAILED TO MEET—THE DIVERSE BODIES OF THE ENVISIONED PARTICIPANTS. THIS PERSPECTIVE ILLUSTRATES HOW THE LOGIC OF POSTFEMINIST GOVERNMENTALITY RADICALLY FAILED WHEN IT CAME TO DIFFERENCES DERIVING FROM THE STRUCTURAL POSITIONING OF THE WOMEN, BUT ALSO INDICATES MOMENTS OF AGENCY AND RESISTANCE AND THE PERSPECTIVES FOR THOSE WHO WERE ABLE AND WILLING TO ACCESS THE OFFERED SUBJECT POSITION. SECOND, THE ANALYSIS SHOWS HOW THIS FAILURE AFFECTED THE WOMEN INVOLVED LESS THAN THE FEMALE PROJECT MANAGER WHO WAS TO BEAR THE CONSEQUENCES. IN THIS RESPECT, THE ANALYSIS SHEDS LIGHT ON THE AMOUNT OF PRACTICAL AND EMOTIONAL WORK THAT THE TASK OF RENDERING THE PROJECT NEVERTHELESS ‘A SUCCESS’ REQUIRED, THE “HIDDEN INJURIES” THIS WORK INVOLVED, AND HOW THIS WORK ULTIMATELY LED TO A REAFFIRMATION OF THE LOGIC OF POSTFEMINIST GOVERNMENTALITY.

TWO RESEARCH QUESTIONS WERE ASKED TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF TRADE IN DDSS BOTH ON THE IMPORT AND EXPORT SIDES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: TO ANSWER THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS, THE PANEL DATA FOR 26 EUROPEAN COUNTRIES FOR THE YEARS 2008–2019 WERE IMPLEMENTED TO ESTIMATE PANEL REGRESSION MODELS. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF VARIANCE INFLATION FACTORS (VIFS) AND BREUSCH–PAGAN AND HAUSMAN TESTS, THE ESTIMATIONS OF PANEL MODELS WERE CONDUCTED FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A DEPENDENT VARIABLE AND MEASURES OF IMPORT AND EXPORT OF DIGITALLY DELIVERED SERVICES AS INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. FINDINGS: THE IMPORTS OF DIGITALLY DELIVERED SERVICES POSITIVELY AFFECT FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, WHILST THE IMPACT OF THE EXPORT OF DIGITALLY DELIVERED SERVICES IS STATISTICALLY INSIGNIFICANT. THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING A CUSTOMER OF DIGITALLY DELIVERED SERVICES THROUGH ITS IMPORT MAY BECOME A GENDER EQUALISER IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. HOWEVER, AS DIFFERENCES IN DIGITAL COMPETENCIES AND GROWTH INTENTIONS PREVENT WOMEN FROM ACTING AS THE PROVIDERS OF DIGITALLY DELIVERED SERVICES, THE EXPORT OF DDSS CAN SUSTAIN THE EXISTING GENDER GAP IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE RESEARCH FINDINGS PROVIDE THE ADDED VALUE IN THE FIELD OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, REFERRING TO INSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND HUMAN CAPITAL THEORY. THE IMPORT OF DDSS SEEMS TO SUPPORT FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS THROUGH THE REDUCTION OF CULTURAL DISTANCE, WHILST THE HUMAN CAPITAL THEORY GAINS THE PERSPECTIVE OF LIMITED DIGITAL COMPETENCIES NEEDED TO EXPORT DDSS AS A PATHWAY TO THE INTERNATIONALISATION OF WOMEN'S VENTURES. THE PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS FOR TRADE POLICY, DIGITALISATION AND GENDER EQUALITY SHOULD AIM NOT ONLY AT SUPPORTING WOMEN'S EXPORT PROPENSITY, BUT SHOULD ALSO FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR DIGITAL COMPETENCIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: INSTEAD OF COMMONLY USED PERSPECTIVE OF INTERNATIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE AUTHORS IMPLEMENTED THE LENS OF CROSS-BORDER TRADE TO CHECK WHETHER THERE IS A LINKAGE BETWEEN INTERNATIONALISATION, MEASURED BY IMPORTS AND EXPORTS OF DDSS AND FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

BASED ON THEIR FIELDWORK, THE AUTHORS DEVELOP A PROCESS FRAMEWORK OF EMANCIPATION-THROUGH-ENTREPRENEURSHIP. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 57 FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS IN TWO RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED COUNTRIES IN WEST AFRICA. NON-PARTICIPANT OBSERVATIONS WERE EMPLOYED AS A SECONDARY DATA COLLECTION TECHNIQUE TO PROVIDE IMPORTANT SOURCES OF INFORMATION FOR TRIANGULATION. FINDINGS: THIS STUDY'S FINDINGS INDICATE THAT THE PROCESS OF FEMALE EMANCIPATION THROUGH ENTREPRENEURSHIP BEGINS WITH THE PERCEPTION OF ONE'S PERSONAL MOTIVATIONS, FOLLOWED BY THE CHOICE OF ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, THE GATHERING OF VARIOUS NECESSARY RESOURCES, AND FINALLY THE COMMENCEMENT AND RUNNING OF A VENTURE TO BRING ABOUT THE DESIRED EMANCIPATION. VARIOUS FACTORS, SUCH AS FAMILY, THE EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT, PERSONAL QUALITIES AND EASE OF OPERATIONS, WERE FOUND TO INFLUENCE THE CHOICE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT HUMAN, SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND POLITICAL CAPITAL INTERACT TO PRODUCE ECONOMIC CAPITAL, A CENTRAL FORM OF CAPITAL FOR THE STARTING AND RUNNING OF VENTURES IN RESOURCE-CONSTRAINED ENVIRONMENTS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: ALTHOUGH EXTANT STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP CAN BE A VEHICLE FOR WOMEN TO LIBERATE THEMSELVES FROM VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS, IT IS AS YET UNCLEAR WHICH PROCESS THESE WOMEN FOLLOW TO ACHIEVE SUCH EMANCIPATION. THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PROCESS FRAMEWORK OF EMANCIPATION-THROUGH-ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS THE KEY CONTRIBUTION OF THIS PAPER. DESPITE EXTANT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATING THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP CAN ASSIST WOMEN IN FINANCIALLY LIMITED SETTINGS TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE, THE SPECIFIC STEPS THESE WOMEN TAKE IN THE PROCESS REMAIN UNCLEAR.

THE HYPOTHESES ARE VALIDATED BY APPLYING A META-ANALYTIC METHOD TO 94 PRIMARY STUDIES THAT WERE PUBLISHED BETWEEN 2004 AND 2021. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE AND CONFIRM THAT ENTREPRENEURIAL PASSION IS THE STRONGEST INDICATOR TO PREDICT SELF-EFFICACY AND THE WILLINGNESS OF ENTREPRENEURS TOWARD SELF-EMPLOYMENT. ROLE MODELS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE AS PREDICTORS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL PERCEPTIONS AND BELIEFS IN DRIVING ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION.

IN PARTICULAR, OLDER WOMEN ARE OFTEN MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN YOUNG WOMEN WHEN THEY START BUSINESSES SINCE THEY POSSESS MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL KNOWLEDGE, AND INDIVIDUALS WITH EXTENSIVE PRIOR EXPERIENCE HAVE A STRONG BELIEF IN THEIR ABILITIES, WHICH CONTRIBUTES TO THE FORMATION OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION.

ECON.,"GENDER ROLES DEMAND THAT WOMEN DEVOTE MORE TIME TO NON-MARKET LABOR SUCH AS CHILDCARE AND HOUSEHOLD RESPONSIBILITIES. THEREFORE, THE LABOR MARKET HINDERS WOMEN’S ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS, WHOSE TIME IS LESS SUBJECT TO THE DEMANDS OF NON-MARKET WORK. THE RESULT IS A PERFORMANCE GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN. TO OBTAIN THE FLEXIBILITY TO MORE EFFICIENTLY PERFORM BOTH THEIR MARKET AND NON-MARKET WORK, MANY WOMEN CHOOSE TO BE SELF-EMPLOYED AND OPERATE THEIR BUSINESSES FROM HOME. USING A LARGE SAMPLE OF US FIRMS, WE FIND THAT WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO OPERATE THEIR OWN BUSINESSES FROM HOME ARE ABLE TO NARROW THE PERFORMANCE GAP BETWEEN MEN AND WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. PLAIN ENGLISH SUMMARY WOMEN PARTIALLY OVERCOME SOCIETAL DISADVANTAGES BY RUNNING BUSINESSES FROM HOME. WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT SYNERGIES BY WORKING FROM HOME THAT ENABLE THEM TO NARROW THE GAP IN PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO MEN. AN ANALYSIS OF OVER 600,000 SMALL BUSINESSES REVEALS THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT GAP IN PERFORMANCE BETWEEN BUSINESSES RUN BY MEN VERSUS THOSE RUN BY WOMEN. PRIOR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT MEN ENJOY STRUCTURAL ADVANTAGES OVER WOMEN DUE TO SOCIETY’S DEMANDS ON WOMEN’S TIME TO PERFORM HOUSEHOLD DUTIES OR PROVIDE CHILDCARE. WE FIND THAT WOMEN ARE ABLE TO NARROW THE RESULTING PERFORMANCE GAP BY OPERATING THEIR BUSINESSES FROM HOME, PROVIDING THEM INCREASED FLEXIBILITY TO MANAGE THEIR TIME. OUR PAPER INDICATES THAT SUPPORTING WOMEN-OWNED BUSINESSES WITH POLICIES THAT GRANT GREATER FLEXIBILITY OR MORE EQUITABLY OR EFFICIENTLY DISTRIBUTE HOUSEHOLD WORK CAN IMPROVE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY. © 2022, THE AUTHOR(S), UNDER EXCLUSIVE LICENCE TO SPRINGER SCIENCE+BUSINESS MEDIA, LLC, PART OF SPRINGER NATURE.",NA,"K.

THE NETFLIX'S LONGEST-RUNNING TV SERIES GRACE AND FRANKIE (2015–2022) EXHIBITS SUCH POTENTIAL, BRINGING TOGETHER AGEING AND FRIENDSHIP INTO THE POPULAR CULTURAL DOMAIN. SET IN THE CONTEMPORARY US, THE SHOW CLOSELY FOLLOWS TWO OVER-70, NEWLY DIVORCED, FEMALE PROTAGONISTS AND FRIENDS, GRACE (JANE FONDA) AND FRANKIE (LILY TOMLIN). DEPICTING THE NEW OPPORTUNITIES AND EXPERIENCES THEY GAIN AND DRAWING ON THE STAR PERSONA OF FONDA AND TOMLIN, THE SHOW PRESENTS AN OPTIMISTIC NARRATIVE OF AGEING INTO OLD AGE. THIS OPTIMISM, HOWEVER, IS MORE AMBIVALENT ABOUT AGEING THAN IT APPEARS, AS IT EMERGES FROM THE CONTEXT OF THE NEOLIBERALIZATION OF AGEING IN THE US AND OTHER WESTERN SOCIETIES. CONSIDERING FRIENDSHIP, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THE AGEING WOMAN'S BODY AND SEXUALITY, AND CARE IN THE SHOW, WE DEMONSTRATE HOW THE SHOW'S OPTIMISM IS PREMISED ON THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE NEOLIBERAL, SUCCESSFULLY AGEING SUBJECT IN THE TWO PROTAGONISTS AND ON THE OTHERING OF THE FOURTH AGE, “‘BLACK HOLE’ OF AGEING,” AS A TIME AND SPACE MARKED BY THE FAILING OF THE BODY, VULNERABILITY AND DEPENDENCY (HIGGS & GILLEARD, 2015, 16). WHILE THE SHOW'S EXPLICIT ENGAGEMENT WITH THE BODILY AGEING IN SOME WAYS MAKES IT MORE RELEVANT TO OLDER AUDIENCE, ITS EVOCATION OF THE FOURTH AGE REFLECTS AND REINFORCES THE BROADER CULTURAL ANXIETY AROUND IT.

A QUANTITATIVE STUDY WAS CONDUCTED ON A SAMPLE OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. A STRUCTURED QUESTIONNAIRE COLLECTED PRIMARY DATA TO OBTAIN THE PROFILE OF A WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR IN CROATIA. THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS DEVELOPED FROM THE LITERATURE REVIEW AND ADAPTED FOR THIS RESEARCH, INCLUDING THE SIX KEY AREAS DERIVED FROM THE HYPOTHESES DEVELOPED IN THE RESEARCH MODEL. THE RESEARCH METHODOLOGY CONSISTS OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS USING PLS-SEM. FINDINGS INDICATE THAT SOFT SKILLS, COMMUNICATION SKILLS, AND HARD SKILLS AFFECT BOTH PUSH AND PULL MOTIVATORS. HOWEVER, ONLY PULL MOTIVATORS POSITIVELY INFLUENCE THE SATISFACTION OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. THE PAPER’S THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTION IS THE CRITICAL SYNTHESIS OF THE RELEVANT ACADEMIC LITERATURE ON WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS, IN PARTICULAR ITS EXAMINATION OF KEY SUCCESS FACTORS UNDERLINED BY COMMUNICATION SKILLS, SOFT SKILLS AND HARD SKILLS.

IT AIMS TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER THERE HAS BEEN A SHIFT IN FAMILY DYNAMICS AND DECISION-MAKING THAT SUPPORTS FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: GIVEN THAT THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY IS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILY DYNAMICS IN THEIR CAREER CHOICE, THIS STUDY HAS TAKEN A QUALITATIVE APPROACH AND CARRIED OUT INTERVIEWS WITH FIFTEEN CHINESE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS TO UNDERSTAND THE ROLE OF RELATIONSHIPS AND FAMILY DYNAMICS IN THEIR CAREER CHOICE. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS NOTE THAT THOUGH THERE ARE CHANGES IN FAMILY DYNAMICS THAT ENCOURAGE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WOMEN STILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CHOOSE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A CAREER AND THERE ARE UNFAIR EXPECTATIONS THAT ARE PLACED ON THEM. THE EXPECTATIONS CREATE UNDUE STRESS WHICH DIRECTLY AFFECTS THEIR ABILITY TO CARRY OUT THEIR PROFESSIONAL DUTIES. THE RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT TO FOSTER THE DEVELOPMENT OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT BODIES SHOULD PROVIDE FURTHER ACCESS TO FAMILY SUPPORT SERVICES THAT CAN FACILITATE WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AND FOSTER ENTREPRENEURIAL THINKING WITHOUT FEELING GUILTY ABOUT FAMILY COMMITMENTS OR UNFAIR EXPECTATIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: RECENT STUDIES ON WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAVE FOCUSED ON VARIOUS FACETS. THE ROLE OF FAMILY DYNAMICS AND RELATIONSHIPS HAS LONG BEEN STUDIED IN THE CONTEXT OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN EMERGING ECONOMIES LIKE CHINA, FAMILY DYNAMICS AND RELATIONSHIPS DETERMINE WHETHER WOMEN CAN CHOOSE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A CAREER CHOICE OR NOT.

BUS. VENTURING,"PRIOR RESEARCH SHOWS THAT CHILDCARE IS A UNIQUE DRIVER FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP ALLOWS WOMEN TO INCREASE TIME ALLOCATION ON CHILD SUPERVISION. YET, WHETHER FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACTUALLY PROMOTES CHILDREARING OUTCOMES REMAINS CONTENTIOUS IN EXTANT LITERATURE. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON CHILD HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION AS A KEY CHILDREARING OUTCOME. DRAWING ON THE OCCUPATIONAL INHERITANCE LITERATURE, WE SUGGEST THAT, IN ADDITION TO SUPERVISION, ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS MAY FOSTER CHILD HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION THROUGH VALUE TRANSMISSION—IN PARTICULAR, TRANSMITTING SELF-DIRECTION VALUES TO CHILDREN. USING NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE DATA FROM CHINA, WE FIND THAT CHILDREN WITH ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS EXHIBIT BETTER HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION OUTCOMES—ESPECIALLY WHEN THEY ARE YOUNGER AND FEMALE. WE FURTHER SHOW THAT BOTH SUPERVISION AND VALUE TRANSMISSION ARE PRESENT, WITH THE LATTER BEING A MORE IMPORTANT MECHANISM. RECONCILING CONFLICTING VIEWS IN THE LITERATURE, OUR STUDY HAS BOTH THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: PRIOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH SUGGESTS THAT WOMEN OFTEN CHOOSE TO BE ENTREPRENEURS OUT OF FAMILY, PARTICULARLY CHILDREARING, CONSIDERATIONS. ENTREPRENEURSHIP OFFERS WORK AUTONOMY AND SCHEDULING FLEXIBILITY, ALLOWING ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS TO BETTER ALLOCATE TIME TO CHILDREARING ACTIVITIES. GIVEN THAT NUMEROUS STUDIES DOCUMENT A POSITIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MATERNAL TIME ALLOCATION AND CHILDREARING OUTCOMES, CONCEIVABLY ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS SHOULD ACHIEVE FAVORABLE CHILDREARING OUTCOMES. ENTREPRENEURIAL RESEARCH FOCUSING ON THE BUSINESS-FAMILY INTERFACE, HOWEVER, SUGGESTS FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS OFTEN FACE UNANTICIPATED PRESSURES THAT LIMIT THEIR ABILITY TO CARE FOR FAMILY MEMBERS. IN ADDITION, SOME FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS MAY BE MOTIVATED MORE BY CAREER THAN BY CHILDCARE CONSIDERATIONS. AS SUCH, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND CHILDREARING OUTCOMES REMAINS CONCEPTUALLY AND EMPIRICALLY AMBIGUOUS. GIVEN THE FOREGOING SITUATION, WE EXAMINE THIS RELATIONSHIP BOTH THEORETICALLY AND EMPIRICALLY, FOCUSING ON CHILD HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION AS A SPECIFIC AND IMPORTANT CHILDREARING OUTCOME. EXAMINING HOW FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP RELATES TO CHILD HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION IS OF BOTH SCHOLARLY AND PRACTICAL IMPORTANCE. FIRST, IT BRINGS ENHANCED CLARITY TO OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE FAMILY- AND CHILD-RELATED CONSEQUENCES OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, THUS AFFORDING RECONCILIATION OF THE AMBIGUOUS PREDICTIONS FOUND IN EXTANT THEORIES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ADVANCE RESEARCH ON FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. EXPLORING THE RELATIONSHIP ALSO ADDS TO THE FAMILY EMBEDDEDNESS PERSPECTIVE IN THE BROADER ENTREPRENEURSHIP LITERATURE, BECAUSE CHILD DEVELOPMENT IS A CRUCIAL COMPONENT WITHIN THE FAMILY DOMAIN. SECOND, OUR RESEARCH HAS PRACTICAL VALUES AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS. PROSPECTIVE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS MAY, REGARDLESS OF THEIR PRE-ENTRY INTENTIONS, BE INTERESTED IN LEARNING HOW ENTERING ENTREPRENEURSHIP COULD AFFECT CHILDREARING OUTCOMES. POLICYMAKERS WORLDWIDE HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY PROMOTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE PAST FEW DECADES, MAINLY DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL CONSIDERATIONS. BECAUSE SUCH EFFORTS LIKELY INCREASE FEMALE PARTICIPATION IN ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES, THEY SHOULD BE EVALUATED TO ACCOUNT FOR THEIR FAMILY OR CHILDREARING CONSEQUENCES IN ADDITION TO THE ECONOMIC AND TECHNOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS. THEREFORE, WE PROVIDE EVIDENCE WHICH PROSPECTIVE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS AND POLICYMAKERS CAN USE TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS. TO STUDY THE EFFECT OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP ON CHILD HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION, WE NOTE THAT THE AMBIGUOUS PREDICTIONS IN EXTANT WORK ARISE BECAUSE IT PREDOMINANTLY FOCUSES ON WHETHER ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS CAN ALLOCATE MORE TIME TO CHILDREARING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WE CALL “SUPERVISION”. WE SUGGEST THAT THIS SUPERVISION MECHANISM IS NOT THE ONLY WAY IN WHICH THE INTERGENERATIONAL IMPACT OCCURS. DRAWING ON SOCIOLOGICAL RESEARCH IN OCCUPATIONAL INHERITANCE, WE PROPOSE THAT ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS COULD FOSTER CHILD HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION THROUGH TRANSMITTING SELF-DIRECTION VALUES, THUS PROMOTING CHILDREN'S ASPIRATIONS AND ACHIEVEMENTS. TO TEST THESE THEORETICAL HYPOTHESES, WE USE DATA FROM A NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE CHINESE HOUSEHOLD SURVEY, WHICH CONTAINS SEPARATELY SURVEYED PARENT AND CHILD DATA. OUR EMPIRICAL ANALYSES REVEAL THAT CHILDREN WITH ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS OUTPERFORM THOSE WITH NON-ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS IN BOTH COGNITIVE AND NONCOGNITIVE SKILLS. THE EFFECT IS STRONGER FOR DAUGHTERS AND YOUNGER CHILDREN. ADDITIONAL ANALYSES VERIFY THE PRESENCE OF BOTH SUPERVISION AND VALUE TRANSMISSION MECHANISMS, WITH VALUE TRANSMISSION BEING MORE IMPORTANTLY IN EXPLAINING THE ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHER EFFECT. FINDINGS IN THIS STUDY DEEPEN OUR KNOWLEDGE ON WHETHER AND HOW ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS FOSTER CHILDREN'S HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION. THEY HIGHLIGHT THAT—IN ADDITION TO SUPERVISION—VALUE TRANSMISSION IS A CRUCIAL CHANNEL THROUGH WHICH ENTREPRENEUR-MOTHERS EXERT AN INTERGENERATIONAL IMPACT ON CHILDREN. OUR RESULTS ALSO INDICATE THAT WOMEN RUNNING LARGER BUSINESSES—LIKELY THOSE WITH CAREER MOTIVES AND TARGETS OF POLICIES THAT PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURSHIP—SEE BETTER CHILD HUMAN CAPITAL FORMATION OUTCOMES DESPITE HAVING POTENTIALLY LIMITED SUPERVISION CAPACITY. FINALLY, OUR FINDINGS NOT ONLY SHED LIGHT ON FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN CHINA, A CONTEXT WITH GROWING RELEVANCE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND RATE OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES, BUT ALSO OFFER GENERALIZABLE INSIGHTS TO OTHER ECONOMIES. © 2023",JBVEE,"D.

A PRODUCTIVE RESEARCH AGENDA LIES IN ANALYZING SOCIAL NETWORKS: IT IS UNKNOWN HOW WOMEN STRUCTURE THEIR SOCIAL TIES WITHIN REFUGEE AND HOST COMMUNITIES, AND WHETHER SOCIAL NETWORKS MATTER FOR THEIR SENSE OF EMPOWERMENT AND WELLBEING. IN 2022, WE SURVEYED SYRIAN REFUGEE (N = 106) AND JORDANIAN (N = 109) WOMEN FROM POOR HOUSEHOLDS ACROSS FIVE NEIGHBORHOODS IN AMMAN. WE IMPLEMENTED A STANDARD NETWORK SURVEY INSTRUMENT (PERSNET) TO ASSESS NETWORK STRUCTURE AND COMPOSITION. WE TESTED ASSOCIATIONS WITH SIX MEASURES (PE, MRS, MTL, CANTRIL, PWB, MSPSS) OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT AND WELLBEING. WE THEN CONDUCTED PARTICIPATORY NETWORK MAPPING (NET-MAP) TO ASSESS LOCAL MEANINGS OF EMPOWERMENT AND VISUALLY MAP THE PATHWAYS BETWEEN SOCIAL ACTORS, COMMUNITY-BASED WORK, AND PSYCHOLOGICAL OUTCOMES. SURVEY DATA SHOW THAT NETWORKS WERE HIGHLY HOMOGENEOUS, SMALLER FOR SYRIANS THAN JORDANIANS (P = 0.0001), AND SMALLER FOR WOMEN IN VERY POOR HOUSEHOLDS (P < 0.0001). AS NETWORK SIZE INCREASED, SO DID LEVELS OF PSYCHOLOGICAL EMPOWERMENT (P = 0.02), MOTIVATION TO LEAD (P = 0.007) AND PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT (P = 0.001). NOTABLY, AS NETWORKS BECAME INCREASINGLY KIN-BASED, EMPOWERMENT LEVELS DECREASED (P = 0.003). NETWORKS WERE MORE DIVERSE FOR COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS, WHO NAMED FEWER FEMALE, MARRIED, AND KIN-BASED PEERS (P ≤ 0.05), AND REPORTED HIGHER LEVELS OF RESOURCEFULNESS (P = 0.01) AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELLBEING (P = 0.002). QUALITATIVE DATA SHOW THAT WOMEN, WHO DESCRIBED EMPOWERMENT AS “ABILITY” AND “PROOF OF EXISTENCE,” DREW UPON VOLUNTEERING WORK TO DIVERSIFY THEIR NETWORKS OUTSIDE THE HOME. SUCH EVIDENCE MATTERS FOR DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES THAT BUILD PROGRAMS FOR WOMEN TO WORK, LEARN, AND SOCIALLY INTERACT. WE CONCLUDE THAT EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR VOLUNTEER WORK IS ONE WAY OF DIVERSIFYING SOCIAL NETWORKS AND EMPOWERING URBAN POOR WOMEN.

FUTUR.,"PURPOSE: THE STARTING PREMISE OF THIS STUDY IS THAT WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT IS THE GOAL FOR SELF-REALIZATION AND THAT THE SUPPORT THAT COMES FROM LOCAL TOURISM STAKEHOLDERS REPRESENTS AN ADEQUATE BASE. IN MANY RURAL AREAS, WOMEN HAVE ESTABLISHED SELF-HELP GROUPS (SHGS), WHICH FACILITATE THE INTERACTION WITH A WIDE RANGE OF STAKEHOLDERS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THIS PAPER IS TO INVESTIGATE THE EFFECTS OF SHGS ON FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND SELF-EMPLOYMENT IN TOURISM. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: TO EXAMINE THE RESEARCH QUESTION, THIS STUDY ADOPTED A QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH THAT INCLUDED A SAMPLE OF 513 WOMEN IN A LESS-ADVANCED RURAL AREA IN SERBIA. FOR THE DATA ANALYSIS, THE GENERALIZED LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL (GLM) WAS USED. FINDINGS: ACCORDING TO THE RESULTS, SELF-EMPLOYMENT IS THE LEADING GOAL OF WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE MAIN LIMITATION IN THE RESEARCH AND THE AUTHORS’ SUGGESTION FOR FUTURE RESEARCH IS TO INCREASE THE SAMPLE SIZE OF FEMALE RESPONDENTS, SO EXAMINATION OF THEIR ATTITUDES AND ROLE IN THE TRAVEL BUSINESS IN THEIR LOCAL SETTINGS MIGHT REACH HIGHER SIGNIFICANCE. THE SECOND ISSUE THAT THE AUTHORS WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT IS A HIGHLY LOCAL CHARACTER OF OUR STUDY, SO THE FUTURE RESEARCH SHOULD INVOLVE OTHER RURAL AREAS IN THE COUNTRY AND FROM ABROAD (E.G. SIMILAR UNDEVELOPED COUNTRYSIDE WITH NOTICEABLE, ACTIVE WOMEN'S ROLE IN LOCAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP). PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE MOST IMPORTANT PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PAPER ARE TWOFOLD: (1) THE RESULTS OF THE RESEARCH HAVE SHOWN THAT THE TOURIST POTENTIAL OF RURAL AREAS CAN BE ENHANCED THROUGH LOCAL TOURISM STAKEHOLDERS' SUPPORT; (2) WOMEN WITHOUT PROFESSIONAL INTEREST OR JOBS IN RURAL AREAS, ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS WHERE THE POPULATION IS TRADITIONALLY DOMINATED BY MEN (HUSBAND/BROTHER/FATHER), HAVE A CHANCE TO EARN AND TO BE ECONOMICALLY MORE INDEPENDENT. THIS RESEARCH CAN AFFECT FUTURE STUDIES TO INVESTIGATE OTHER ASPECTS OF EMPOWERMENT DEPENDING ON THE DIFFERENCE OF REGIONS, FROM ONE SIDE, AND ALSO ALTERNATIVE OPPORTUNITIES FOR TOURISM AND LOCAL DEVELOPMENT IN LESS-ADVANCED RURAL AREAS, FROM ANOTHER SIDE. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE STUDY ANALYZES THE TOURISM POTENTIAL OF THE RURAL AREAS (WHICH ARE LESS ADVANCED AND MOSTLY VERY POOR IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, SUCH AS SERBIA). IN THIS CASE, THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE EMPLOYMENT, SOCIAL INCLUSION OF WOMEN, DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TOURISM STRATEGIES, IMPLEMENTATION OF DESTINATION MARKETING, ETC.

RESULTS BASED ON DATA FROM 44,418 FIRMS IN 91 DEVELOPING ECONOMIES SHOW THAT, AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, INCREASED EMPLOYMENT SHARE OF FOREIGN INVESTED FIRMS HAS A POSITIVE ASSOCIATION WITH WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP, NAMELY, IT BOOSTS THE PRESENCE OF FEMALE LEADERS IN NEW VENTURES AND SMALL BUSINESSES, AS FOREIGN FIRMS HELP BREAK LOCAL CONVENTIONS UNFAVORABLE TO FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS.

TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THESE NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS ARE DESIGNED TO IMPROVE ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES AND, MORE GENERALLY TO GENERATE LEARNINGS. ALTHOUGH LEARNING OUTCOMES CAN REDUCE STRESS, THE CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH THIS CAN HAPPEN ARE NOT FULLY UNDERSTOOD. THE STUDY LOOKS PARTICULARLY AT THE EFFECT OF LEARNING, INTERACTION WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS AND GENDER. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A SIX-MONTH THREE-WAVE LONGITUDINAL STUDY OF 120 NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS HAS BEEN CONDUCTED TO INVESTIGATE THE BEFORE-AND-AFTER EFFECTS OF TRAINING ON STRESS REDUCTION. THE TRAINING IS SPECIALLY DESIGNED TO DEVELOP COMPETENCIES, SHARE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT BUSINESS CREATION AND SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE PROJECT, NOT TO REDUCE PER SE STRESS. FINDINGS: THE TRAINING HAS NO DIRECT EFFECT ON STRESS LEVELS. HOWEVER, RESULTS INDICATE THAT INTERACTING WITH OTHERS HAS A POSITIVE MODERATING EFFECT ON TRAINING AS STRESS REDUCTION, JUST AS GENDER HAS. SPECIFICALLY, WOMEN REDUCE THEIR STRESS THROUGH TRAINING WHILE MEN SEE THEIRS INCREASING. THE AUTHORS CONCLUDE THAT BREAKING ISOLATION THROUGH TRAINING IS A RELEVANT WAY TO REDUCE ENTREPRENEURIAL STRESS FOR NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: TRAINING PROGRAMS OFFER DIFFERENT WAYS TO DELIVER THE LEARNING CONTENT (ONLINE, IN COHORTS, IN THE CONTINUOUS ENTRANCE, ETC.). THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY SUGGEST ENSURING THAT THE PARTICIPANTS WILL HAVE OPPORTUNITIES TO INTERACT WITH OTHERS AS IT REDUCES THE STRESS ON NASCENT ENTREPRENEURS. NEVERTHELESS, THE AUTHORS CANNOT DEMONSTRATE THAT THIS HAS A LONG-TERM EFFECT AS OUR TIMEFRAME IS LIMITED TO SIX MONTHS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY IS QUALITATIVE IN NATURE, BASED ON NARRATIVE INQUIRY. THE PURPOSIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE WAS USED AS A PART OF A NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING METHOD TO COLLECT THE DATA FROM RURAL WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS FROM THREE DISTRICTS (KHULNA, SHATKHIRA, AND SYLHET) IN BANGLADESH ENGAGED IN FAMILY ENTREPRENEURSHIP. NO NEW INFORMATION WAS FOUND AFTER COLLECTING THE DATA FROM SEVEN (07) RESPONDENTS; THUS, THEY WERE CHOSEN AS THE FINAL SAMPLE SIZE. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT RURAL WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS FACED PRIMARILY SOCIAL AND CULTURAL, FINANCIAL, AND SKILL-RELATED CHALLENGES, THOUGH THEY FACE OTHER CHALLENGES TO SURVIVE THEIR FAMILY ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE ATTITUDE AND PERCEPTION OF SOCIETY TOWARD WOMEN AND THEIR ROLES ARE AT THE ROOT OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL BARRIERS. RESEARCHERS ALSO FOUND THAT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES HAVE A COLOSSAL IMPACT ON RURAL WOMEN AND THE OTHER PROBLEM. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: ALTHOUGH ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR SOCIO-ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN THESE DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THIS RESEARCH ADDS TO THE EXISTING INFORMATION BY HIGHLIGHTING THE MAIN CHALLENGES THAT RURAL WOMEN FACE WHEN THEY WANT TO BE BUSINESS OWNERS AND ENTREPRENEURS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: RESEARCH ON RURAL WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN BANGLADESH IS LIMITED AND NEW.

ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS, LEGAL CONDITIONS, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT THAT INFLUENCE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS’ MANAGERIAL SKILLS. RESEARCH DESIGN & METHODS: A CONCEPTUAL MODEL WAS DEVELOPED BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW, AND THE DATA COLLECTED FROM 120 WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN POLAND WAS UTILISED TO CONSTRUCT THE SCALE. THE ITEMS WERE GENERATED AFTER VALIDITY, RELIABILITY, AND EXPLORATORY FACTOR ANALYSIS WERE CONDUCTED WITH SPSS SOFTWARE. THE FINAL DEVELOPED SCALE WAS VALIDATED AMONG 140 WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN MALAYSIA AND THE DATA WAS ANALYSED THROUGH STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING (AMOS). FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS, LEGAL CONDITIONS, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT ARE THE MAIN FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THE MANAGERIAL SKILLS OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. FURTHER ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT ECONOMIC CONSTRAINTS, LEGAL CONDITIONS, AND SOCIAL SUPPORT, VARY ACROSS COUNTRIES AND INFLUENCE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS’ BUSINESSES. WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN POLAND CONSIDER ASSERTIVENESS, RISK-TAKING, RESPONSIBILITY, PATIENCE, AND DILIGENCE AS ESSENTIAL FEATURES OF ENTREPRENEURS, WHILE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN MALAYSIA BELIEVE PATIENCE, INDEPENDENCE, SELF-CONFIDENCE, RESPONSIBILITY, COURAGE, AND THE ABILITY TO WORK WITH PEOPLE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FEATURES. IMPLICATIONS & RECOMMENDATIONS: THIS STUDY IDENTIFIED THE MAIN FACTORS THAT IMPACT WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS AND HIGHLIGHTS THAT THE FACTORS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THEIR MANAGERIAL SKILLS, WHICH CAN PROVIDE KNOWLEDGE FOR INDUSTRY PLAYERS AND GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO WANT TO EASE THE START-UP PROCESS AND PREVENT FAILURES. CONTRIBUTION & VALUE ADDED: THIS STUDY ADVANCES KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE VARIOUS FACTORS INFLUENCING WOMEN’S BUSINESSES IN EMERGING COUNTRIES LIKE MALAYSIA AND DEVELOPED COUNTRIES LIKE POLAND.

DESPITE THIS, THE CONTINENT'S ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IS BELOW EXPECTATIONS, DUE TO NUMEROUS FACTORS CONSTRAINING THE GROWTH AND SUSTAINABILITY OF AGRICULTURAL SMES. THESE CONSTRAINTS HAVE BEEN EXACERBATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY WAS TO UNDERSTAND THE PATHWAYS THROUGH WHICH THE PANDEMIC AFFECTED AGRI-SMES, WITH SPECIFIC FOCUS ON ASSESSING THE DIFFERENTIATED EFFECTS ARISING FROM THE SIZE OF THE AGRI-SME AND THE GENDER OF THE OWNER-MANAGER. METHODS: DATA WAS COLLECTED FROM OVER 100 AGRI-SMES, RANGING IN SIZE FROM SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS WITH ONE EMPLOYEE TO AGRI-SMES EMPLOYING UP TO 100 PEOPLE, IN SIX AFRICAN COUNTRIES. MIXED METHODS WERE USED TO ANALYSE THE DATA WITH CHANGES IN BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARISING FROM CHANGING MARKET ACCESS, REGIMENTED HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES AND CONSTRAINED LABOUR SUPPLY ASSESSED USING VISUALISATIONS AND DESCRIPTIVE STATISTICS. LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELLING WAS EMPLOYED TO DETERMINE THE SET OF VARIABLES CONTRIBUTING TO AGRI-SME BUSINESS DOWNTURN DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. RESULTS: ALL SURVEYED AGRI-SMES WERE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY COVID-19-ASSOCIATED RESTRICTIONS WITH THE SIZE OF THE FIRM AND GENDER OF THE OWNER-MANAGERS RESULTING IN DIFFERENTIATED IMPACTS. THE SMALLEST AGRI-SMES, MAINLY OWNER-MANAGED BY WOMEN, WERE MORE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE DISRUPTIONS IN MARKETING THEIR GOODS AND MAINTAINING THEIR LABOUR SUPPLY. LARGER AGRI-SMES MADE CHANGES TO THEIR BUSINESS OPERATIONS TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT GUIDELINES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND MADE INVESTMENTS TO MANAGE THEIR LABOUR SUPPLY, THUS SUSTAINING THEIR BUSINESS OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, LOGISTIC REGRESSION MODELLING RESULTS SHOW THAT FINANCING PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC, ENGAGING IN PRIMARY AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION, AND BEING FURTHER FROM URBAN CENTRES SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FIRM INCURRING BUSINESS LOSSES. CONCLUSIONS: THESE FINDINGS NECESSITATE ENGENDERED MULTI-FACETED AGRI-SME SUPPORT PACKAGES THAT ARE TAILORED FOR SMALLER-SIZED AGRI-SMES.

THE FINDINGS INDICATE THAT INNOVATIVENESS, NETWORK CAPABILITY, SOCIAL SUPPORT, FAMILY INTERFERENCE WITH ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP EXERT SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCES ON THE EORD PROCESS, AND CAN BE CATEGORISED INTO THREE DISTINCT HIGH EORD PATHWAYS. NOTABLY, INNOVATIVENESS EMERGES AS A CRUCIAL FACTOR IN THIS PROCESS. ADDITIONALLY, FOR MUMPRENEURS, THE CONTEXTUAL FACTORS EMBEDDED IN THE SOCIAL STRUCTURE MUST NOT BE DISREGARDED.

J. ENTREP. BEHAV. RES.,"PURPOSE: IN RECENT YEARS, THE TOPIC OF WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS GAINED INCREASING ATTENTION FROM RESEARCHERS AND POLICYMAKERS. ITS ROLE IN ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN WIDELY RECOGNIZED IN SEVERAL STUDIES. HOWEVER, THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GENDER IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION IS AN UNDEREXPLORED ASPECT IN PARTICULAR AT A COUNTRY-LEVEL PERSPECTIVE. THIS PAPER AIMS TO ANSWER THE FOLLOWING QUESTION: DOES FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IMPACT INNOVATION AT A NATIONAL LEVEL? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: USING A PANEL DATASET OF 35 ORGANIZATION FOR ECONOMIC CO-OPERATION AND DEVELOPMENT (OECD) MEMBER COUNTRIES OVER THE PERIOD 2002–2019, THE AUTHORS CARRIED OUT A COMPREHENSIVE ECONOMETRIC ANALYSIS, BASED ON THE FIXED-EFFECT MODEL, THE RANDOM-EFFECT MODEL AND THE FEASIBLE GENERALIZED LEAST SQUARES ESTIMATOR, AS WELL AS A BATTERY OF TESTS TO PREVENT PROBLEMS OF MULTICOLLINEARITY, HETEROSCEDASTICITY AND AUTOCORRELATION OF THE ERROR TERMS. IN DOING SO, THE AUTHORS FOUND CONSISTENT AND ROBUST RESULTS ON THE LINEAR AND NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION, USING SELECTED COUNTRY INDICATORS FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR (GEM) CONSORTIUM, THE WORLDWIDE GOVERNANCE INDICATORS (WGI) AND THE WORLD DEVELOPMENT INDICATORS (WDI), INCLUDING FEMALE SELF-EMPLOYMENT, FEMALE NASCENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND R&D INVESTMENT AND CONTROLLING FOR THE SAME RELATIONSHIPS IN THE CASE OF MEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FINDINGS: THIS STUDY SHOWS THAT THE LEVEL OF R&D INVESTMENT, WHICH ACCORDING TO THE LITERATURE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS A PROXY OF INNOVATION, IS HIGHER WHEN THE LEVEL OF WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS LOW. HOWEVER, EXPLORING MORE IN DEPTH THIS RELATIONSHIP AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN MALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION, THE AUTHORS FOUND TWO IMPORTANT AND NEW RESULTS. THE FIRST ONE INVOLVES THE DIFFERENT IMPACT ON R&D INVESTMENT OF FEMALE SELF-EMPLOYMENT AND FEMALE NASCENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN PARTICULAR, FEMALE SELF-EMPLOYMENT APPEARS TO HAVE A LINEAR NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE R&D, WHILE THE IMPACT OF FEMALE NASCENT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS STATISTICALLY NONSIGNIFICANT. THE SECOND ONE AFFECTS THE NONLINEARITY OF THE NEGATIVE EFFECT, SUGGESTING THAT VERY DIFFERENT CHALLENGES ARE POSSIBLE AT DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN ADDITION, ANALYZING THE ROLE OF HUMAN CAPITAL IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN R&D INVESTMENT AND WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP, IT EMERGES THAT HIGHER EDUCATION (AS THE MAIN COMPONENT OF HUMAN CAPITAL) MAKES EARLY-STAGE WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY CONSUMING, WHICH PROMOTES R&D INVESTMENT. A HIGHER LEVEL OF EDUCATION LESSENS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE NEGATIVE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE SIMPLEST TYPE OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP (FEMALE SELF-EMPLOYMENT) AND R&D INVESTMENT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE ORIGINALITY OF THE STUDY IS THAT IT PROVIDES NEW EVIDENCE REGARDING THE LINK BETWEEN WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INNOVATION AT THE MACRO LEVEL, WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON SELF-EMPLOYED WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS AND EARLY-STAGE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN THIS SENSE, TO THE BEST OF THE AUTHORS' KNOWLEDGE, THIS STUDY IS AMONG THE FEW SHOWING A NONLINEAR RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND COUNTRY-LEVEL INNOVATION AND A NEGATIVE IMPACT ONLY IN THE CASE OF FEMALE SELF-EMPLOYMENT. MOREOVER, THIS STUDY HAS RELEVANT IMPLICATIONS FROM A POLICYMAKING PERSPECTIVE, IN TERMS OF PROMOTING MORE PRODUCTIVE WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP. © 2023, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",NA,"B.

WE CONTRIBUTE TO THEORY DEVELOPMENT ON HOW IN A PAKISTANI CONTEXT THE ISLAMIC VALUES AND PAKISTANI CULTURAL VALUES SHAPE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL IDENTITY OF THE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS THROUGH AN INTERSECTIONAL ANALYSIS. WE DRAW ON FIVE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS TO ILLUSTRATE HOW THE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS EXECUTE THEIR VENTURES AND CARRY THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL IDENTITY WHILE CARRYING A BLEND OF ISLAMIC VALUES AND PAKISTANI CULTURAL VALUES. PAKISTANI WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS EMPLOY THE ISLAMIC NORMS AND VALUES THAT ARE PARTICULARLY PRACTISED BY THE FAMILY AS A BOUNDARY, HOWEVER, THE CULTURAL NORMS SOMETIMES OVERWEIGHT THE ISLAMIC VALUES IN CONSTRUCTION OF IDENTITY. THERE IS AN EVIDENCE FOR NEGOTIATING PROCESS THAT ACTS AS AN ENABLER TO MAKE SPACE FOR INDIVIDUALISM, HONOUR AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN ORDER TO RESIST THE RIGID CULTURAL INTERPRETATION OF BEHAVIOURAL NORMS, VARIOUS CULTURAL, RELIGIOUS AND FAMILIAL IDENTITIES ARE CRAFTED TO EXPAND THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS ALLOWED.

THEY ARE FACING A NEW NORMAL, CHARACTERIZED BY HIGH UNCERTAINTY AND RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS. THIS PAPER AIMS TO USE THE EXPERIENTIAL LEARNING THEORY APPLIED TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP TO PROPOSE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL BRICOLAGE APPROACH TO STUDY HOW FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS CAN OVERCOME THIS TYPE OF CRISIS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: WITHIN THE RESEARCH DESIGNS OF CONCEPTUAL PAPERS, THE STUDY IS SITUATED WITHIN THE MODEL APPROACH BECAUSE THE AUTHORS PROPOSE NOVEL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CONSTRUCTS TO ANSWER THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THEORETICAL PROPOSITIONS. FINDINGS: THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT THE ENTREPRENEURIAL BRICOLAGE PROCESS REPRESENTS A TYPE OF STRATEGY THAT ALLOWS THESE WOMEN TO ADAPT TO THIS NEW NORMAL. BASED ON THIS APPROACH, THE AUTHORS SUGGEST THAT CROWDFUNDING REPRESENTS A FINANCIAL RESOURCE AT HAND FOR BOTH PRE-EXISTING FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS AND NEW FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE THEORETICAL IMPLICATIONS SUGGEST AN ALTERNATIVE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK OF THE ENTREPRENEURIAL BRICOLAGE PROCESS TO ANALYSE THE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES AND DURING CRISIS’ CONTEXTS. THE MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS SUGGEST THAT CROWDFUNDING IS A FINANCIAL RESOURCE AT HAND FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS THAT ALLOW THEM TO PERFORM WELL, INNOVATE OR IMPLEMENT GROWTH STRATEGIES AND HAVE MORE CHANCES OF SURVIVING AND GROWING DURING THE CRISIS. FINALLY, THE POLICY IMPLICATIONS ARE ORIENTED TO THE PROMOTION OF THIS KIND OF FINANCIAL ALTERNATIVE AND THE GENERATION OF TRUST FOR USERS, ALONG WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF A REGULATORY FRAMEWORK TO ATTRACT MORE INVESTORS AND ENTREPRENEURS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY PROVIDES USEFUL INFORMATION ON HOW THE CRISIS GENERATED BY THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC HAS BEEN AFFECTING FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

THIS STUDY BUILDS ON THE MODEL OF ENTREPRENEURIAL EVENT AND SOCIAL ROLE THEORY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION ON FEASIBILITY, DESIRABILITY AND INTENTIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE HYPOTHESES ARE TESTED WITH A SAMPLE OF 879 BULGARIAN SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING STUDENTS FROM 15 UNIVERSITIES. TO TEST THE MODELS, THIS STUDY USES ORDINARY LEAST SQUARES AND LOGISTIC REGRESSIONS WITH ROBUST STANDARD ERRORS AND HAYES MEDIATION ANALYSIS WITH BOOTSTRAP BIAS-CORRECTED CONFIDENCE INTERVAL ESTIMATIONS FOR INDIRECT EFFECTS. TWO-STAGE HECKMAN REGRESSIONS TO CONTROL FOR SAMPLE SELECTION BIAS AND OTHER ROBUSTNESS CHECKS INCLUDING PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING WERE USED. FINDINGS: RESULTS SHOW THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, MEASURED AS PARTICIPATION IN AN ENTREPRENEURSHIP COURSE, HAS A STRONGER IMPACT ON FEASIBILITY, DESIRABILITY AND INTENTIONS FOR TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR FEMALE STEM STUDENTS COMPARED TO THEIR MALE COUNTERPARTS. AS SUCH, THIS STUDY SUPPORTS THE NOTION THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION COULD BE PART OF A SOLUTION TO COUNTERACT SOCIETAL NORMS THAT POSITION TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS A LESS DESIRABLE AND/OR LESS FEASIBLE CHOICE FOR WOMEN IN STEM. HOWEVER, ATTENTION SHOULD BE PAID TO THE OPERATIONALIZATION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, AS OTHER MEASURES OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION (ROLE MODELS, ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION SUPPORT) DID NOT HAVE A MODERATION EFFECT WITH GENDER.

HUMAN BEHAVIOR PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN DETERMINING CONSERVATION OUTCOMES. THE ACTIONS OF MULTI-NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL NON-GOVERNMENT ORGANIZATIONS (NGOS) OFFER A WAY TO CRITICALLY ASSESS BEHAVIOR CHANGE APPROACHES ACROSS GEOGRAPHIES AND CONSERVATION TARGETS. IN THIS PAPER, WE SEEK TO UNDERSTAND THE RANGE OF WAYS IN WHICH PRACTITIONERS IN ONE SUCH ORGANIZATION CONCEPTUALIZE AND INTEGRATE HUMAN BEHAVIOR INTO THEIR CONSERVATION PROGRAMS. THIS PAPER USES A SURVEY OF THE NGO'S INTERVENTIONS (N = 161) TO IDENTIFY SEVERAL CASE STUDIES, THREE OF WHICH WE PRESENT HERE TO ILLUSTRATE HOW HUMAN BEHAVIOR CONSIDERATIONS WERE ADDRESSED IN DIFFERENT CONTEXTS ACROSS THE GLOBE. THE FIRST CASE FOCUSES ON POLITICAL SUPPORT FOR WATER QUALITY LEGISLATION IN LONG ISLAND, USA, THE SECOND ON WOMEN'S ENGAGEMENT IN ECO-ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN OCEANIA, AND THE THIRD ON FISHING AND AGRICULTURAL PRACTICE IN COMMUNITIES NEAR MAHALE MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, TANZANIA. USING THE LENS OF APPLIED WORK ACROSS VARIED CONTEXTS OFFERS HIGH-LEVEL INSIGHTS ON (1) THE ARRAY OF BEHAVIORAL GOALS AND STRATEGIES CURRENTLY USED IN CONSERVATION INTERVENTIONS; (2) CHALLENGES FACING PROJECT MANAGERS IN USING BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS; AND (3) AREAS OF OPPORTUNITY FOR IMPROVING AND SCALING UP THE USE OF BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS IN CONSERVATION.

FOR EXAMPLE, WOMEN ARE HINDERED BY GENDER ROLES, MALE DOMINATED NETWORKS AND EXPECTATIONS THAT THEY TAKE OF THE FAMILY. RECENTLY, SCHOLARS HAVE ARGUED THAT DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES MAY PROVIDE WOMEN WITH AVENUES TO BYPASS THESE BARRIERS. YET, THERE IS LITTLE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT HOW FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS ENGAGE WITH DIGITAL TOOLS, AND HOW THIS MAY HELP THEM BYPASS GENDERED, CULTURAL BARRIERS. USING 18 INTERVIEWS WITH FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS IN BEIJING AND SHANGHAI, WE IDENTIFY FOUR AFFORDANCES (VIRTUAL NETWORKING, ONLINE LEARNING, OPPORTUNITY CREATION AND SCALING-UP) THAT WOMEN USE TO OVERCOME THE CULTURAL BARRIERS TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WE FIND THAT THROUGH ENGAGING THESE AFFORDANCES, THE WOMEN FEEL EMPOWERED AND ABLE TO CHALLENGE TRADITIONAL STRUCTURES.

SEEKING TO INVEST IN BUSINESSES RUN BY FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS WOULD GIVE MUCH GREATER UTILITY TO THE FUNDER INTERESTED IN SOCIAL VALUES.

THIS PAPER ADDRESSES ONE MAIN QUESTION: HOW CAN THE EGYPTIAN GOVERNMENT EMPOWER WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS THROUGH KEY POLICY INTERVENTIONS? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE RESEARCH PAPER IS BASED ON QUANTITATIVE METHODOLOGY USING THREE SETS OF THE LATEST DATA AVAILABLE FROM EGYPT'S GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR REPORT FOR 2019 AND 2018, IN ADDITION TO THE EGYPTIAN LABOR MARKET PANEL SURVEY OF 2018. IT EXAMINES THE PROBABILITY FOR WOMEN TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS IN EGYPT'S CURRENT ECOSYSTEM.

J. ORGAN. ANAL.,"PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE HOW SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP EMPOWERS WOMEN AND HOW IT INFLUENCES THE EXISTING GENDER BASED INTERSECTIONALITIES IN THE SOCIETY. THIS PAPER IS BASED ON A SINGLE CASE STUDY OF A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL STARTUP CALLED “PAHAL,” WHICH USED SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGIES TO ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO ENGAGE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES, WHICH HELPED THEM IN GAINING ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE RESEARCHER ALONGSIDE THE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR VISITED THE FIELD FOR EIGHT MONTHS FROM AUGUST 2016 TO MARCH 2017 AND INTERVIEWED MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDER-EMPLOYEES (AS PARTNERS) OF THE SOCIAL ENTERPRISE. THIS STUDY WAS DONE BY CONDUCTING INTERVIEWS WITH ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN ALL THE THREE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL PHASES, I.E. PRE-PAHAL, DURING-PAHAL AND AFTER-PAHAL. THE INTERVIEWS AND OBSERVATIONS WERE RECORDED AND ANALYSED USING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL LENS AND INTERSECTIONALITY. FINDINGS: “PAHAL INITIATIVE” – IS A SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTERVENTION THAT HELPED THE WOMEN IN THE HOUSEHOLD TO START A FOOD DELIVERY BUSINESS WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR. CONSEQUENTLY, WOMEN GAINED CONFIDENCE AND SELF-RESPECT. THE ATTITUDE OF MEN IN THE HOUSEHOLD CHANGED WHEN THE WOMEN IN THE HOUSEHOLD GENERATED ADDITIONAL INCOME. IT IMPACTED THEIR POSITION AND STATUS WHICH LED TO AN INCREASE IN THEIR PARTICIPATION IN DECISION-MAKING IN THE HOUSEHOLD AND ECONOMIC INDEPENDENCE. THE WOMEN BECOME MORE INTERACTIVE AND EXPRESSIVE IN A PREDOMINANTLY PATRIARCHAL HOUSEHOLD. WITHIN ONE YEAR, THE ENTREPRENEUR HAD TO STOP THE PAHAL INITIATIVE. THEN, THIS STUDY OBSERVED AND RECORDED THAT THIS EVENT CURTAILED THE ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY THE WOMEN IN THEIR VILLAGE AND THEIR SOCIAL STATUS REVERTED TO WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE INITIATIVE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: FIRST, SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGIES LEAD TO ECONOMIC VALUE CREATION AND LEAD OVERALL SOCIO-ECONOMIC GAINS. SECOND, SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGIES ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS OF PATRIARCHY AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION. THIRD, ECONOMIC ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY WOMEN CHANGED THE SOCIAL PERCEPTIONS OF THE FAMILY MEMBERS TOWARDS WOMEN IN THE FAMILIES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: FROM THIS CASE STUDY, ONE OBSERVES THAT SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS A STRONG POTENTIAL TO BRING ABOUT SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC CHANGE. THIS STUDY HELPS POLICYMAKERS AND NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANISATIONS TO SOLVE POVERTY AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION RELATED PROBLEMS USING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL STRATEGIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY USES SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTERVENTION TO UNDERSTAND AND BRING ABOUT CHANGE IN THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS OF WOMEN IN RURAL INDIA. THIS STUDY USES AN INTERSECTIONALITY LENS TO MAKE SENSE OF THE DATA, REALITY AND REFLECTS ON HOW INTERSECTIONAL POSITIONS ARE ALTERED WHEN WOMEN ARE ECONOMICALLY EMPOWERED EITHER THROUGH TRAINING OR THROUGH A PROPER ORGANISATION OR BOTH. © 2021, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",NA,"A.

IN RECENT YEARS, IT HAS BEEN GIVEN IMPORTANCE TO SUPPORT DEVELOPMENT AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN AGRICULTURE IN TÜRKIYE IN ORDER TO SOLVE THE EXISTING PROBLEMS. FOR THIS PURPOSE, THE YOUNG FARMER PROJECT WAS PUT INTO EFFECT WITH THE DECISION OF THE COUNCIL OF MINISTERS IN 2016. WITH THIS PROJECT, IT IS AIMED TO ENSURE THAT YOUNG FARMERS STAY IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR BY PROVIDING THE SUPPORT THEY NEED, AND TO PREVENT MIGRATION FROM RURAL TO URBAN BY ENCOURAGING THEIR AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION AND ACTIVITIES. IN THIS RESEARCH, THE APPLICATION PROCESS OF THE FARMERS WHO RECEIVED SUPPORT BETWEEN 2016 AND 2017 IN TEKIRDAG PROVINCE WITH THE YOUNG FARMER PROJECT, HOW THEY CARRIED OUT THE PROJECT, WHAT KIND OF DIFFICULTIES THEY FACED WHILE CARRYING OUT, HOW THEY CONTINUED IT, AND WHERE THEY COULD CARRY IT WAS DETERMINED. A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 106 YOUNG FARMERS WHO RECEIVED SUPPORT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE RESEARCH. 54% OF THE YOUNG FARMERS PARTICIPATING IN THE RESEARCH ARE WOMAN FARMERS. THE FACT THAT MALE FARMERS HAVE EXISTING BUSINESSES REGISTERED ON THEM THAT THEY WORK IN OTHER PAID JOBS BESIDES FARMING, POSITIVE DISCRIMINATION AGAINST WOMEN WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PROJECT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF FEMALE YOUNG FARMER APPLICANTS AND WINNERS. 82.1% OF THE YOUNG FARMERS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT ALSO RESIDE IN THE RURAL AREA BEFORE THE PROJECT, AND 13.2% LIVE BOTH IN THE CITY CENTER AND IN THE RURAL AREAS. THE RATE OF THOSE WHO STARTED LIVING IN RURAL AREAS AFTER RECEIVING PROJECT SUPPORT IS 4.7%. IT HAS BEEN DETERMINED THAT YOUNG FARMERS WHO OWN LIVESTOCK ENTERPRISES DO NOT HAVE AN INCREASE IN THEIR INCOME LEVELS, AND THEY HAVE DIFFICULTY IN MEETING THEIR BORROWING AND OPERATING INPUT COSTS. YOUNG PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE SUPPORT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE YOUNG FARMER PROJECT EXPRESS THE OPINION THAT THE PROJECT WILL NOT ENCOURAGE AGRICULTURE AND ANIMAL HUSBANDRY. FOR WOMEN FARMERS, THE MOST IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION OF THE PROJECT IS THAT THEY HAVE OWNED BUSINESSES FOR THE FIRST TIME, AND FOR MALE FARMERS, THEY HAVE FURTHER EXPANDED THEIR EXISTING BUSINESSES. © BU ÇALIŞMA TEKIRDAĞ NAMIK KEMAL ÜNIVERSITESI TARAFINDAN CREATIVE COMMONS LISANSI (HTTPS://CREATIVECOMMONS.ORG/LICENSES/BY-NC/4.0/) KAPSAMINDA YAYINLANMIŞTIR.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: SEMI-STRUCTURED IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED. A WEB-BASED SURVEY WAS ALSO CONDUCTED TO COLLECT DATA FROM PARTICIPANTS WHO WERE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS. THEMATIC CONTENT ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE COLLECTED DATA. FINDINGS: AS A RESULT OF THE ANALYSIS, THREE MAIN THEMES WERE DEVELOPED RELATED TO “CHOKEPOINTS” THAT AFGHAN FEMALE ENGINEERS FACE ALONG THE PATH TO STARTING THEIR OWN CONSTRUCTION COMPANIES: “ENTERING AND STUDYING ENGINEERING,” “CAREER DEVELOPMENT” AND “STARTING HER OWN ENGINEERING BUSINESS”; THE AUTHORS ADDRESS THE SUBTHEMES OF BARRIERS AND OPPORTUNITIES CONFRONTED BY AFGHAN WOMEN AT EACH CHOKEPOINT. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: DUE TO CIVIL UNREST, THE AUTHORS ARE ONLY ABLE TO REACH A SAMPLE OF AFGHAN FEMALE ENGINEERS WORKING IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF KABUL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: AFGHANISTAN SHOWS, PERHAPS, THE MOST SEVERE UNDERREPRESENTATION OF FEMALE ENGINEERS OF ALL COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD, YET NO RESEARCH GIVES THEM A VOICE TO EXPLAIN THE CHALLENGES THEIR FACE TO STARTING THEIR OWN ENGINEERING/CONSTRUCTION BUSINESSES. THE AUTHORS ARE ABLE TO REPORT THEIR PERCEPTIONS AND ARTICULATE RECOMMENDATIONS TO ENCOURAGE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE ENGINEERING/CONSTRUCTION SECTOR IN AFGHANISTAN. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: AFGHAN WOMEN FACE SIGNIFICANT BARRIERS TO HAVING MEANINGFUL CAREERS IN THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING AND MEDICINE PROFESSIONS. THE FINDINGS PROVIDE INFORMATION FOR REGULATORS REGARDING WHY AFGHAN WOMEN DO NOT START THEIR OWN ENGINEERING FIRMS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: TWO EXISTING FRAMEWORKS FOR ANALYSING WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP, NAMELY THE 5M (BRUSH ET AL., 2009) AND THE 8M (ABUHUSSEIN AND KOBURTAY, 2021) FRAMEWORKS, ARE USED TO EXAMINE THE LOCAL STORIES OF WOMEN IN RURAL ETHIOPIA TO PROVIDE A COUNTER-NARRATIVE TO THE GRAND NARRATIVE OF “ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT”. THE LOCAL STORIES ARE DERIVED FROM 16 FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS AND 32 INTERVIEWS. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS PROVIDE A COUNTER-NARRATIVE TO THE GRAND NARRATIVE OF “ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT”, EVIDENT IN ETHIOPIA AND IN INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT GENERALLY, WHILE DEMONSTRATING LARGER STRUCTURAL ISSUES AT PLAY. THEY CHALLENGE ENTREPRENEURSHIP'S SOLELY POSITIVE EFFECTS. WHILE WOMEN RECOGNIZE THE BENEFITS OF HAVING A BUSINESS, PARTICULARLY IN TERMS OF FINANCIAL GAINS, EMPOWERMENT AND SOCIAL RECOGNITION, THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHT NEGATIVE CONSEQUENCES, INCLUDING UNCERTAINTY, CONCERNS FOR THEIR OWN PERSONAL SAFETY, CRITICISM, STRESS, LIMITED SOCIAL LIFE AND FEAR OF INDEBTEDNESS AND POVERTY. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: POLICYMAKERS, SCHOLARS AND DEVELOPMENT PROFESSIONALS ARE URGED TO REFLECT ON THE LIMITATIONS OF “ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR DEVELOPMENT” AND TO CONSIDER THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS THAT PROMOTING AN ACRITICAL GRAND NARRATIVE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP COULD HAVE ON WOMEN'S LIVES.

CASE OVERVIEW/SYNOPSIS: THE CASE IS ABOUT “REKHAAKRITI”, A HANDICRAFT ARTISAN-ORIENTED FIRM, WHICH DEALS IN THE BUSINESS OF SELLING HANDICRAFTS ITEMS LIKE TRADITIONAL WOODEN TOYS, MOONJ BASKETS, RICE BOWLS AND VERMILION BOXES, IN BOTH BUSINESS-TO-BUSINESS (B2B) AND BUSINESS-TO-CONSUMER (B2C) MARKETS. INCORPORATED AS A NON-GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATION (NGO) IN THE YEAR 2014, “REKHAAKRITI” WAS FOUNDED WITH THE PURPOSE OF PRESERVING, PROMOTING AND ADVANCING THE MOONJ HANDICRAFT. THROUGHOUT ITS FORMATIVE YEARS, THE ORGANIZATION EXPERIENCED SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES AND GOT ALMOST ON THE EDGE OF COLLAPSE. THE DILEMMA THAT SURROUNDED REKHA SINHA, A KEY FOUNDING MEMBER OF “REKHAAKRITI”, WAS WHETHER TO CARRY OR DISSOLVE THE ORGANIZATION. BUT, AFTER MUCH CONTEMPLATION, SHE DECIDED TO CONVERT THE ORGANIZATION TO A SOLE PROPRIETORSHIP FIRM IN THE YEAR 2017. HOWEVER, THE RESTRUCTURING DECISION WAS ALSO PROVING TO BECOME LESS EFFECTIVE IN ATTAINING THE OBJECTIVES FOR WHICH THE FIRM GOT ESTABLISHED. THIS LED THE OWNER, REKHA SINHA, TO FURTHER DUG DEEP TO IDENTIFY OBSTACLES (BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL) THAT IMPEDE HER FIRM’S EXPANSION AND GROWTH. THIS CASE NARRATES REKHA SINHA'S INTRICATE ENTREPRENEURIAL PATH IN BUILDING AN INNOVATIVE HANDICRAFT ORGANIZATION AND EXPLAINS HOW SHE OVERCAME THE OVERALL ORGANIZATIONAL AND OPERATIONAL OBSTACLES. THE CASE PROVIDES THE CONTEXT FOR STUDENTS TO ASSUME THE ROLE OF PROTAGONIST AND EXPLORE CREATIVE STRATEGIES FOR OVERCOMING MARKET OBSTACLES THROUGH UPSKILLING, DESIGN INTERVENTION AND PRODUCT INNOVATION. COMPLEXITY ACADEMIC LEVEL: THE CASE STUDY IS INTENDED FOR THE STUDENTS PURSUING THEIR GRADUATION AND POST-GRADUATION COURSES IN BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT STUDIES, MARKETING AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

SCI.,"THIS STUDY INVESTIGATES THE GENDER GAP IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. DIGITIZATION HAS CREATED VAST ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR AND HAS LOWERED MANY BARRIERS TO ENTRY, THUS REDUCING TRADITIONAL FRICTIONS REGARDING ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND POTENTIALLY INCREASING OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEMALE FOUNDERS. HOWEVER, ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE HAS SUGGESTED THAT FEMALE TECHNOLOGY FOUNDERS ARE RARE AND THAT WOMEN ARE UNDERREPRESENTED IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATHEMATICS ROLES. BASED ON INDIVIDUAL CAREER HISTORIES COLLECTED FROM MORE THAN 42 MILLION U.S.-BASED LINKEDIN PROFILES, INCLUDING MORE THAN 1.3 MILLION FOUNDERS, WE EXPLORE WHETHER THERE ARE HIGHER RATES OF FEMALE FOUNDERS IN TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES RELATIVE TO OTHER INDUSTRIES. OUR ANALYSIS REVEALED THE FOLLOWING: (1) FEMALES WERE ONLY HALF AS LIKELY AS MALES TO FOUND BUSINESSES IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. (2) FEMALES WERE LESS LIKELY TO FOUND SUCCESSIVE BUSINESSES (I.E., SERIAL FOUNDERS), WHICH WAS EVEN MORE PRONOUNCED IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY. (3) WHEN WE USED THE GENDER GAP IN LABOR FORCE PARTICIPATION AS A BASELINE, THE GENDER GAP IN TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP WAS PARTICULARLY LARGE, EVEN COMPARED WITH OTHER MALE-DOMINATED INDUSTRIES (E.G., CONSTRUCTION). (4) THE GENDER GAP IN TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER RATES OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP BY FEMALES IN LOWER POSITIONS IN THE ORGANIZATIONAL HIERARCHY. IN CONTRAST, FEMALES WHO REACHED THE C-SUITE IN TECHNOLOGY SECTORS WERE 16% MORE LIKELY TO FOUND FIRMS COMPARED WITH THEIR FEMALE C-SUITE COUNTERPARTS IN NONTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRIES. COMBINED, THE RESULTS PROVIDE A NUANCED VIEW OF THE GENDER GAP IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. COPYRIGHT: © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S)",NA,"M.

WIDELY RECOGNISED AS A WOMEN-DOMINATED SECTOR, TOURISM IS DEEMED TO BE A FACILITATOR OF WOMEN'S DEVELOPMENT FOLLOWING THE UN SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS). AS THE EXISTING LITERATURE SUGGESTS, WOMEN'S INVOLVEMENT IN TOURISM ACTIVITIES SUPPORTS LOCAL ECONOMIC GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHILE FACILITATING SOCIAL TRANSFORMATION THAT ENABLES THEM TO CREATE THEIR OWN IDENTITIES.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: BASED ON A CONFIGURATION PERSPECTIVE, SIX ANTECEDENTS OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND ENTREPRENEURIAL COGNITION ARE INTEGRATED TO EXPLORE MULTIPLE CONCURRENT FACTORS AND CAUSALLY COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS AFFECTING FEMALE AND MALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. FINDINGS: THIS STUDY INDICATES THAT THE CONFIGURATIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND ENTREPRENEURIAL COGNITION CAN ACHIEVE HIGH FEMALE AND MALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THERE ARE SIMILARITIES AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN FEMALE AND MALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP FROM A CONFIGURATION PERSPECTIVE. PERCEIVED OPPORTUNITY PLAYS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR BOTH WOMEN AND MEN, AND THE ABSENCE OF FEAR OF FAILURE IS ALSO IMPORTANT FOR MALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THERE IS A COMPLEMENTARY EFFECT AMONG ENTREPRENEURIAL COGNITIONS IN THE ABSENCE OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. IN THE CONFIGURATIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT AND ENTREPRENEURIAL COGNITION, FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP BENEFITS MORE FROM INFORMAL INSTITUTIONS, WHEREAS REGULATIVE AND COGNITIVE INSTITUTIONS PLAY A GREATER ROLE IN MALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP.

THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS BEEN HIT HARD AND FIRMS HAVE EXPERIENCED A MYRIAD OF CHALLENGES, BUT THESE CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN HETEROGENEOUS ACROSS FIRMS. THIS PAPER EXAMINES ONE IMPORTANT DIMENSION OF THIS HETEROGENEITY: THE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC ON WOMEN-LED AND MEN-LED BUSINESSES. THE PAPER EXPLOITS A UNIQUE SAMPLE OF CLOSE TO 40,000 MAINLY FORMAL BUSINESSES FROM 49 COUNTRIES COVERING THE MONTHS BETWEEN APRIL AND SEPTEMBER 2020. THE FINDINGS SHOW THAT WOMEN-LED MICRO-BUSINESSES, WOMEN-LED BUSINESSES IN THE HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY, AND WOMEN-LED BUSINESSES IN COUNTRIES MORE SEVERELY AFFECTED BY THE COVID-19 SHOCK WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIT COMPARED WITH BUSINESSES LED BY MEN. AT THE SAME TIME, WOMEN-LED MICRO-FIRMS WERE MARKEDLY MORE LIKELY TO REPORT INCREASING THE USE OF DIGITAL PLATFORMS, BUT LESS LIKELY TO INVEST IN SOFTWARE, EQUIPMENT, OR DIGITAL SOLUTIONS. FINALLY, THE FINDINGS ALSO SHOW THAT WOMEN-LED BUSINESSES WERE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE RECEIVED SOME FORM OF PUBLIC SUPPORT ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN HIT HARDER IN SOME DOMAINS. IN A CRISIS OF THE MAGNITUDE OF THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC, EVIDENCE TRACING THE IMPACT OF THE SHOCK IN A TIMELY FASHION IS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO HELP INFORM THE DESIGN OF POLICY INTERVENTIONS.

GENDER ENTREPRENEURSHIP,"PURPOSE: THIS PAPER AIMS TO ADD TO THE THEORIZATION OF THE GENDER DYNAMIC IN RURAL AREAS BY INVESTIGATING THE MOTIVES OF WOMEN WHO JOIN THEIR FAMILY FIRM (OR THEIR SPOUSE'S FAMILY FIRM) AND THEREBY DEFY THE DEMOGRAPHIC TREND OF RURAL FLIGHT. THE CONTEXT OF THIS STUDY IS THE DEPOPULATION OF RURAL AREAS WITH THE CLOSING OF BASIC SERVICES AND RELOCATION OF THE YOUNGER POPULATION, AND EDUCATED WOMEN IN PARTICULAR, TO URBAN AREAS. CONSEQUENTLY, RURAL FAMILY BUSINESSES RISK FAILING TO FIND SUCCESSORS AND SUFFERING FORCED CLOSURE OR RELOCATION. THE EMPIRICAL SITE OF THE STUDY IS RURAL FAMILY FIRMS IN SWEDEN, A CONTEXT CHARACTERIZED BY A HIGH LEVEL OF GENDER EQUALITY IN LEGISLATION AND CULTURE BUT GENDER-CONSERVATIVE BUSINESS STRUCTURES IN RURAL REGIONS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE EMPIRICAL CASE IN THIS PAPER BUILDS ON A QUALITATIVE STUDY OF NINE (9) LIFE COURSE NARRATIVES OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN A RURAL REGION OF SOUTHERN SWEDEN WHO HAVE RETURNED TO RURAL AREAS TO JOIN THEIR FAMILY BUSINESS. THE AUTHORS FOLLOW THE VIEW ESTABLISHED BY GENDER SCHOLARS THAT WOMEN ARE ACTIVE AGENTS IN NAVIGATING THEIR LIVES, AND THEIR LIFE STORY NARRATIVES OFFER INSIGHT INTO THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT INFORM THEIR CHOICE TO STAY OR RETURN TO RURAL LOCATIONS. IN SWEDEN, THE SETTING FOR THE STUDY, GENDER EQUALITY IS WIDELY SUPPORTED BY LEGISLATION, POLICY AND INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORKS AND POPULAR UNDERSTANDING OF GENDER RELATIONS. IN CONTRAST TO THE GENDER-PROGRESSIVE POLICIES OF SWEDEN AT LARGE, WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN RURAL REGIONS OF SWEDEN TENDS TO FOLLOW TRADITIONAL GENDER HIERARCHIES AND FACE SIMILAR CONSTRAINTS AS IN RURAL AREAS OF OTHER COUNTRIES. THE JUXTAPOSITION OF THESE COMPETING SETS OF IDEALS MAKES SWEDEN AN IMPORTANT AND INTERESTING PLACE TO STUDY AND DRAW INSIGHTS FROM THE EXPERIENCES OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS REVEAL THAT WOMEN WHO CHOOSE TO JOIN RURAL FAMILY FIRMS VIEW THEM PRIMARILY IN A POSITIVE LIGHT AND SEE THIS CHOICE AS ALIGNED WITH THEIR NEED FOR PROFESSIONAL FLEXIBILITY AND ASSERTIVENESS, REWARDING RELATIONSHIPS, AND A CALM, SECURE, WELL-BALANCED LIFE. THEORETICALLY, THE STUDY IMPLIES THAT WOMEN CHOOSING TO ENGAGE IN RURAL FAMILY FIRMS SEEK NON-MATERIAL BENEFITS, SUCH AS WORK–LIFE BALANCE AND SOCIAL SUPPORT, AND MAY BE DRIVEN IN PART BY A SENSE OF PSYCHOLOGICAL OWNERSHIP THAT EXTENDS TO THE RURAL COMMUNITY. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE FINDINGS PROVIDE NOVEL INSIGHTS ON WOMEN AS ACTIVE AGENTS IN NAVIGATING THEIR LIVES AND THE INTRINSIC (E.G. ALIGNMENT OF PERSONAL VALUES) AND EXTRINSIC (E.G. COMMUNITY SUPPORT) MOTIVES THAT INFORM THEIR DECISIONS. THE STUDY ALSO RAISES QUESTIONS REGARDING HOW WOMEN PERCEIVE THEMSELVES AS “FITTING IN” TO RURAL SETTINGS AND TO WHAT EXTENT THE SENSE OF SECURITY WITHIN THESE SETTINGS THAT THE WOMEN DESCRIBE MAY BE CONTINGENT UPON FACTORS SUCH AS THEIR FAMILIES' EMBEDDEDNESS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THEIR CONFORMITY TO THE LOCAL SOCIAL NORMS. © 2022, SHQIPE GASHI NULLESHI AND VIKTORIJA KALONAITYTE.",NA,"S.

WHEN GIVEN A CHOICE OF 11 AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS IN A GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, WE FIND THE MAJORITY (54 PERCENT) OF THE APPLICANTS CHOSE TO ENTER INTO THE POULTRY VALUE CHAIN, AND WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY TO CHOOSE POULTRY THAN MEN. THIS ARTICLE FINDS EVIDENCE OF MORE RESTRICTIVE GENDER NORMS IN NORTHERN NIGERIA STATES, WHICH LOWERS WOMEN'S LIKELIHOOD OF ENTERING INTO AGRICULTURAL VALUE CHAINS WHERE THE POTENTIAL FOR PROFIT MAY BE HIGHER. THE GENDER BIAS IN SECTORAL CHOICE IS ALSO ATTRIBUTED TO DIFFERENCES IN WORK EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY IN AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES AND IN THE CHOSEN VALUE CHAIN, AS WELL AS IN LAND OWNERSHIP.

TECHNOL. PEOPLE,"PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXAMINE THE COMPARATIVE LINK BETWEEN MOBILE MONEY (MOMO) AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN EAST AFRICA. APART FROM ANALYSING THE DATA TO EXAMINE LOCATIONAL, GENDER AND AGE HETEROGENEITIES IN THE MOMO–ENTREPRENEURSHIP NEXUS, THE AUTHORS EXPLORE THE POTENTIAL ROLES OF DIGITAL SAVINGS AND ACCESS TO DIGITAL CREDIT IN SERVING AS TRANSMISSION CHANNELS IN THE LINK BETWEEN MOMO ADOPTION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS PAPER USES NATIONALLY REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLES FROM KENYA, TANZANIA AND UGANDA WHICH WERE EXTRACTED FROM THE FIFTH WAVE OF THE INTERMEDIA FINANCIAL INCLUSION INSIGHTS (FII) PROGRAM. THE AUTHORS EMPLOY A SUITE OF QUASI-EXPERIMENTAL MICROECONOMETRIC TECHNIQUES—STANDARD INSTRUMENTAL VARIABLE ESTIMATION, LEWBEL TWO-STAGE LEAST SQUARES (2SLS) AND PROPENSITY SCORE MATCHING. FINDINGS: OVERALL, THE AUTHORS’ PREFERRED ENDOGENEITY-CORRECTED RESULT SUGGESTS THAT ADOPTERS OF MOMO ARE 24.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THIS RESULT IS ROBUST TO ALTERNATIVE WAYS OF CONCEPTUALISING MOMO ADOPTION AND DIFFERENT METHODS USED IN RESOLVING ENDOGENEITY. THE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MOMO AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS STRONGER IN KENYA COMPARED TO UGANDA AND NOT SIGNIFICANT IN TANZANIA. THE SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ASSOCIATION BETWEEN MOMO AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS OBSERVED AMONG WOMEN AND RURAL RESIDENTS AND NOT FOR THEIR MALE AND URBAN-LOCATED COUNTERPARTS. MOMO SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCES ENTREPRENEURSHIP AMONG THE YOUTH AND ADULTS BUT NOT THE ELDERLY. DIGITAL SAVINGS AND ACCESS TO DIGITAL CREDIT SERVE AS IMPORTANT CHANNELS THROUGH WHICH FINTECH ADOPTION INFLUENCES ENTREPRENEURSHIP. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP-ENHANCING EFFECT OF MOMO ADOPTION CAN BE EXTENDED TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF EMPLOYING MOMO AS A POLICY TOOL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE ATTAINMENT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOAL (SGD) 8 WHICH SEEKS TO ENSURE FULL AND PRODUCTIVE EMPLOYMENT AND DECENT WORK FOR ALL. INCOMES THAT ACCRUE FROM ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES CAN ALSO INCREASE HOUSEHOLDS' PURCHASING POWER TO DECREASE POVERTY (SDG 1), REDUCE FOOD INSECURITY (SDG 2) AND PROVIDE RESOURCES NEEDED TO PURCHASE CLEAN AND MODERN COOKING AND LIGHTING FUELS (SGD 7). SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THE GROWING RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND VULNERABLE EMPLOYMENT IN AFRICA HAS BEEN AN ISSUE OF CONCERN TO POLICY MAKERS. THESE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN CAUSED BY THE INABILITY OF POLICY MAKERS TO CREATE ADEQUATE JOBS. THE STUDY’S FINDINGS SHOW THAT POLICIES GEARED TOWARDS ENHANCING THE DIFFUSION OF MOMO CAN AUGMENT EFFORTS BEING MADE BY GOVERNMENTS TO DECREASE THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN AFRICA THROUGH INCREASED ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE EMPLOYMENT EFFECT OF MOMO CAN ALSO BE REALISED THROUGH THE EMERGENCE OF DIGITAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP WHICH HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS HAVING THE POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM AFRICAN ECONOMIES TO KNOWLEDGE-BASED ECONOMIES FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY CONTRIBUTES TO THE MOMO LITERATURE BY DEVIATING FROM THE FOCUS OF EXISTING STUDIES WHICH HAVE EMPHASISED MORE ON THE INTERMEDIATE OUTCOME (PERFORMANCE) AND LESS ON THE IMMEDIATE (I.E. ENTREPRENEURSHIP OR SMALL BUSINESS VENTURING). THIS HELPS TO HIGHLIGHT THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP EFFECT OF MOMO WHICH HAS EVOLVED FROM A SIMPLE PEER-TO-PEER PAYMENT SYSTEM TO A COMPLEX ONE THAT PROVIDES SAVINGS, CREDIT, INSURANCE AND OTHER PRODUCTS. © 2022, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",NA,"I.

FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY INVESTIGATED HOW WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS’ SOCIAL NETWORKS HELPED THEM TO CLEAR THE GENDERED HURDLES THAT HINDERED THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL ENDEAVORS IN THE TIMES OF COVID-19. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: HIGHLY PERSONAL TOPICS LIKE GENDER STEREOTYPES ARE COMPLEX AND NEBULOUS, AS IS ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS LIVED EXPERIENCE. MOREOVER, THE COVID-INDUCED CRISIS COMPLICATES THE CONTEXT FURTHER, WHICH IS WHY THE ADDRESSAL OF QUESTIONS ABOUT GENDERED STEREOTYPES IN THE PROCESS OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND THE ROLE OF SOCIAL NETWORKS IN THAT PROCESS, WARRANTS A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH APPROACH. CONSEQUENTLY, THIS STUDY RELIED ON IN-DEPTH SEMISTRUCTURED INTERVIEWS FOR INVESTIGATING THE STUDY’S RESEARCH QUESTIONS. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT RESEARCH PARTICIPANTS USED THE COVID-INDUCED CRISIS CONDITIONS AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT THE EXISTING OCCUPATIONAL GENDER STEREOTYPING IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE CONTEXT OF URBAN TURKEY THAT OPENED A WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR THE WOMEN PARTICIPANTS TO ENTER INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IN ADDITION, SOCIAL NETWORKS SIGNIFICANTLY HELPED THE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS TO ACQUIRE RESOURCES, AND PROVIDED THE LEVERAGE NEEDED TO CLEAR THE GENDERED HURDLES THAT HINDERED THE WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURIAL ENDEAVORS.

NOT ONLY IS ESCALATION ONE OF THE LESS-RESEARCHED BIASES IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP BUT ALSO MOST OF THE EXISTING STUDIES HAVE BEEN EITHER LIMITED TO SPECIFIC CONTEXTS OR EXCLUSIVELY LIMITED TO MEN ENTREPRENEURS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO EXPLORE THE ANTECEDENTS OF ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT AMONG A SAMPLE OF IRANIAN WOMEN AND MEN ENTREPRENEURS TO ADDRESS THESE GAPS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: BY CONDUCTING A NARRATIVE INQUIRY, DATA WERE COLLECTED THROUGH SEMI-STRUCTURED AND IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH NINE WOMEN AND 10 MEN IRANIAN ENTREPRENEURS WHO WERE FOUNDER/OWNERS OF A SMALL BUSINESS AND HAD INTRODUCED AT LEAST ONE PRODUCT TO THE MARKET. FINDINGS: ACCORDING TO THE FINDINGS OF THIS STUDY, THE FEAR OF LOSING AUTONOMY AND FEAR OF BEING BLAMED BY ONE’S FAMILY WERE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF ESCALATION OF COMMITMENT AMONG THE WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS, WHILE OVERCONFIDENCE, SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY AND HOPING TO GAIN MORE PROFITS WERE THE MAIN ANTECEDENTS OF ESCALATION AMONG MEN ENTREPRENEURS.

ENTERPRISING COMMUNITIES,"PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THIS PAPER IS TO EXAMINE THE MOTIVES AND THE BUSINESS MODEL CANVAS ADOPTED BY URBAN POOR WOMEN TO SET UP MICROENTERPRISES IN THE INFORMAL SECTOR. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE QUALITATIVE ANALYSIS USED IN THE PAPER IS BASED ON EMPIRICAL FINDINGS FROM FIELD WORK CONDUCTED IN MUMBAI AND PUNE DISTRICT IN THE STATE OF MAHARASHTRA SITUATION ON THE WESTERN COAST OF THE INDIAN SUB-CONTINENT. IN TOTAL, 63 WOMEN MICROENTREPRENEURS WERE INTERVIEWED USING AN INTERVIEW GUIDE, WHICH CONTAINED OPEN-ENDED QUESTIONS REGARDING CHOICES MADE TO BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR, BUSINESS CANVAS MECHANICS, FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SUPPORT TO START AND MANAGE THEIR BUSINESSES. THE PAPER PRESENTS FINDINGS ACROSS THE SAMPLE AND TWO SELECTED CASE STUDIES. FINDINGS: IN CONTRAST TO THE VIEW THAT WOMEN’S INFORMAL SECTOR MICRO ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A RESULT OF “INVOLUNTARY EXCLUSION” OR “POVERTY”, THIS PAPER FOUND THAT WOMEN’S MOTIVES ARE A RESULT OF A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING SUPPLEMENTING FAMILY INCOME, GAIN SOCIAL RECOGNITION AND A VARIETY OF OTHER REASONS. THE BUSINESS CANVAS OF THE ENTREPRENEURS FOCUSSED ON KEY PARTNERS, RESOURCE PLANNING, CUSTOMER ORIENTATION AND SALES PROMOTION. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE LIMITATION OF THE STUDY IS THAT IT FOCUSSED ON WOMEN MICRO ENTREPRENEURS IN THE URBAN INFORMAL SECTOR IN MUMBAI AND PUNE. SIMILAR STUDIES CAN BE CARRIED OUT IN OTHER MEGA-METRO CITIES WITH A LARGE URBAN POOR POPULATION IN INDIA. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: VENTURING IN THE MICROENTERPRISE SECTOR IS AN IMPORTANT WAY FOR EMPLOYMENT GENERATION AMONGST WOMEN FROM THE LOW-INCOME GROUPS IN THE URBAN INFORMAL SECTOR. WOMEN ARE BECOMING IMPORTANT PLAYERS IN THE MICROENTERPRISE SECTOR AND HAVE TREMENDOUS RELEVANCE IN INDIA AS THE CONTRIBUTION OF THIS SECTOR TO THE INDIAN ECONOMY IS SIGNIFICANT.

ADDITIONALLY, IT EXPLORES HOW SOCIAL MEDIA HAS INFLUENCED AND AFFECTED WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS' BUSINESSES AND EXAMINES THE SOCIAL CHANGES IN THEIR LIVES INSTIGATED BY USING SOCIAL MEDIA FOR BUSINESS PURPOSES. METHODS: THE STUDY ADOPTS A QUALITATIVE-INDUCTIVE APPROACH AND UTILIZES SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 30 WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS FROM VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN THREE MAIN CITIES IN JORDAN. RESULTS: THE PAPER HIGHLIGHTS THAT SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS HAVE PROVIDED WOMEN WITH VARYING DEGREES OF EMPOWERMENT. THE DEGREE OF EMPOWERMENT DIFFERS AMONG WOMEN AND IS ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR MOTIVATIONS FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WOMEN WHO STARTED THEIR BUSINESSES WITH OPPORTUNITY MOTIVATIONS AND USED SOCIAL MEDIA AS THEIR PRIMARY PLATFORM ARE FOUND TO BE MORE EMPOWERED COMPARED TO WOMEN WHO ENGAGED IN NECESSITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE RESEARCH FINDINGS CONFIRM THAT FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS HAVE EXPERIENCED POSITIVE EFFECTS BY USING SOCIAL MEDIA AS THEIR PRIMARY BUSINESS PLATFORM.

J. DEV. RES.,"WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS’ PERFORMANCE IN CONNECTION TO THEIR CONTRIBUTION TO FAMILY LIVELIHOOD IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES IS YET AN UNDER-RESEARCHED POTENTIAL FOR ADDRESSING POVERTY AND ITS ROOTS. THEIR PERFORMANCE CAN BE CHARACTERISED AS MULTI-DIMENSIONAL. NEXT TO BUSINESS PERFORMANCE (E.G. PROFITABILITY AND GROWTH), WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS AIM AT A PERSONAL- AND A SOCIETAL PERFORMANCE AS WELL. ALTHOUGH SUCH A MULTI-DIMENSIONAL PERFORMANCE REFLECTS THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN THE INDIVIDUAL AND THE COMMUNAL NATURE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, ESPECIALLY IN DEVELOPING COUNTRIES, THE CONDITIONS FOR WOMEN TO ACHIEVE THIS PERFORMANCE IN SUCH CHALLENGING CONTEXTS SEEM STILL UNFAVOURABLE. THIS STUDY ANALYSES HOW ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION (EO), DISTINGUISHED IN ITS THREE DIMENSIONS, OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS OPERATING IN A CONSTRAINED CONTEXT CAN LEVERAGE THEIR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE SO THAT THEY CAN ENHANCE THEIR SOCIETAL PERFORMANCE, IN THIS CASE, THEIR FAMILY LIVELIHOOD. IN PARTICULAR, ANTECEDENTS OF EO, DETERMINANTS OF BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND ITS INFLUENCE ON FAMILY LIVELIHOOD ARE RESEARCHED.

ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THE ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF HAS ITS ROOTS IN THE UNIVERSAL, RATIONAL AND AUTONOMOUS SUBJECT, WHICH WAS SHAPED IN A MALE FORM DURING THE ENLIGHTENMENT, THE PURPOSE OF THIS STUDY IS TO CONCEPTUALISE FEMINIST RESISTANCE AS A PROCESS THROUGH WHICH THE AUTONOMOUS SUBJECT CAN BE DE-STABILISED. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: EMPIRICALLY, THIS STUDY DRAWS ON AN EXTENSIVE RESEARCH PROJECT ON WOMEN’S RURAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT INCLUDES 32 IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN RURAL SWEDEN. THIS STUDY INTERPRETED EXPRESSIONS OF RESISTANCE FROM THE WOMEN BY USING AN ANALYTICAL FRAMEWORK THE AUTHORS DEVELOPED BASED ON JONNA BORNEMARK’S PHILOSOPHICAL TREATISE. FINDINGS: FEMINIST RESISTANCE UNFOLDS AS AN INTERACTIVE AND ITERATIVE LEARNING PROCESS WHERE THE SUBJECT RECOGNISES THEIR VOICE, STRENGTHENS THEIR VOICE AND BELIEFS IN A RELATIONAL PROCESS AND FINALLY SEES THEMSELVES AS A FULLY FLEDGED ACTOR WHO FINDS WAYS TO OVERCOME OBSTACLES THAT GET IN THEIR WAY. CONCEPTUALISING RESISTANCE AS A LEARNING PROCESS STANDS IN SHARP CONTRAST TO THE IDEA OF RESISTANCE AS ENACTED BY THE AUTONOMOUS SELF. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY HELPS RESEARCHERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT WHAT THEY MAY HAVE SEEN AS A SIGN OF WEAKNESS AMONG WOMEN, IS INSTEAD A SIGN OF STRENGTH: IT IS A FIRST STEP IN LEARNING RESISTANCE THAT MAY HELP WOMEN CREATE A LIFE DIFFERENT FROM THAT PRESCRIBED BY THE POSTFEMINIST DISCOURSE. IN THIS WAY, RESEARCHERS CAN AVOID REPRODUCING WOMEN AS “WEAK AND INADEQUATE”. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THROUGH THE RE-WRITING OF FEMINIST RESISTANCE, THE MASCULINE ENTREPRENEURSHIP DISCOURSE INCLUDING THE NOTION OF THE AUTONOMOUS SELF IS CHALLENGED, AND A COUNTERNARRATIVE TO THE POSTFEMINIST ENTREPRENEURIAL WOMAN IS DEVELOPED. THEORISING RESISTANCE AS A LEARNING PRACTICE ENABLES A MORE TRANSFORMING RESEARCH AGENDA, MAKING IT POSSIBLE TO SEE WOMEN AS RESISTING POSTFEMINIST EXPECTATIONS OF ENDLESS COMPETITION WITH THEMSELVES AND OTHERS. © 2022, KARIN BERGLUND, HELENE AHL, KATARINA PETTERSSON AND MALIN TILLMAR.",NA,"K.

MARK. MANAGE.,"THE OPEN INNOVATION FRAMEWORK IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT FOR ENTREPRENEURS, BUT RELATED STUDIES HAVE NOT ADEQUATELY EXPLORED THE IMPACT OF INSTITUTIONS AND IMPORTANT SOCIAL CONSTRUCTS – SUCH AS GENDER OR FAMILY EMBEDDEDNESS - ON FIRM PERFORMANCE. YET, THESE CONSTRUCTS MAY INFLUENCE OUTCOMES. TO CONTRIBUTE TO UNRAVELING THIS UNKNOWN, WE ANALYZED SURVEY RESPONSES FROM 198 MAN AND 188 WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN TECHNOLOGY PARKS ACROSS CHINA AND FOUND THAT GENDER PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN HOW OPEN INNOVATION PRACTICES RELATE TO FIRM PERFORMANCE, WITH WOMEN-LED FIRMS ENGAGED IN OPEN INNOVATION OUTPERFORMING THOSE LED BY MEN. THIS RELATIONSHIP STRENGTHENED AS PERCEIVED INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IMPROVED, YET IT DISSIPATED WHEN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS WERE EMBEDDED IN FIRMS WITH FAMILY INVOLVEMENT. WE POSIT THAT THIS IS CAUSED BY DIFFERENCES IN PERCEPTIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND GENDERED INSTITUTIONS, AS FAMILY IS IN CHINA, AMONG GENDERS. OUR STUDY, THEREFORE, USES GENDER AND GENDERED INSTITUTIONS TO ENRICH THE OPEN INNOVATION, FAMILY BUSINESS, AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP LITERATURE. WE SHOW THAT THESE FACTORS INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURS' PERCEPTIONS OF INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY AND THEREFORE PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THE PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES OF FIRMS ENGAGING IN OPEN INNOVATION ACTIVITIES IN A GIVEN INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT. MANAGERIAL SUMMARY: OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT GAINED BY BEING EMBEDDED WITHIN TECHNOLOGY PARKS IS IMPORTANT FOR ENTREPRENEURS TO ENGAGE IN OPEN INNOVATION PRACTICES AND THE RESULTING PERFORMANCE BENEFITS THAT ACCRUE, WHICH INDICATES THAT POLICYMAKERS SHOULD FOCUS ON IMPROVING SUCH SUPPORT. IN ADDITION, OUR STUDY SHOWS THAT INSTITUTIONAL QUALITY IS PERCEIVED DIFFERENTLY BY GENDERS. THE RESULT IS THAT WOMEN-LED FIRMS INVOLVED IN OPEN INNOVATION PERFORM SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN THOSE LED BY MEN. THIS FINDING PROVIDES AN IMPORTANT INCENTIVE FOR INVESTORS TO ENGAGE WITH WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN TECHNOLOGY PARKS. HOWEVER, INVESTORS SHOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE PERFORMANCE BENEFITS FOR WOMEN-LED FIRMS DISAPPEAR WHEN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS ARE EMBEDDED IN FIRMS WITH FAMILY INVOLVEMENT.

SCI.,"WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS CONSIDERED BY MANY RESEARCHERS AS AN IMMINENT PHENOMENON OF THE 21ST CENTURY, ESPECIALLY FOR DEVELOPING COUNTRIES. DUE TO ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE ECONOMY AND SOCIETY, RECENT STUDIES HAVE FOCUSED ON INVESTIGATING ITS MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS, AS WELL AS ACHIEVEMENTS. MOREOVER, RESEARCHERS HAVE COME UP WITH DIFFERENT ENTREPRENEURIAL PERSPECTIVES IN DIFFERENT SOCIETIES AND CULTURES AND HAVE CALLED FOR FURTHER ANALYSIS. IN THIS CONTEXT, THE MAIN PURPOSE OF THIS RESEARCH WAS TO ASSESS THE DRIVING FACTORS, CHALLENGES, AND PERSPECTIVES OF WOMAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN A POST-COMMUNIST COUNTRY CONTEXT. AS PART OF THE DATA COLLECTION PROCESS, A SURVEY WAS CONDUCTED WITH 36 FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS OPERATING IN THE CAPITAL CITY OF ALBANIA, TIRANA. THE STUDY RESULTS REVEAL THAT, EVEN THOUGH THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE PERCENTAGE OF WOMEN WHO FEEL THAT THEY ARE BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND PERCENTAGE OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS WHO PERCEIVE THAT THEIR GENDER HAS POSITIVELY AFFECTED THE BUSINESS GROWTH, THERE IS A POSITIVE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE REGARDING THE PERCENTAGES OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS WHO HAVE BEEN SUPPORTED BY THEIR FAMILIES AND PARTNERS AND THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED HERITAGE FROM THEIR FAMILIES. SPECIAL ATTENTION IS ADDRESSED TO THE DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT WOMEN EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL DEVELOPMENT. ANOTHER AIM OF THIS RESEARCH IS TO PROVIDE DIFFERENT RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION BY THE POLICYMAKERS TO IMPROVE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM IN ALBANIA. © 2023 BY THE AUTHORS.",NA,"E.

HIGH. EDUC.,"SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS A RESEARCH TOPIC THAT HAS RECEIVED GREAT ATTENTION FROM ACADEMICS ESPECIALLY IN RECENT YEARS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS IN THE LITERATURE ARE FAR FROM UNIVOCAL, FOR EXAMPLE, THERE IS NO CLEAR CONCEPTUAL DELIMITATION OF THE TERM, AND IT IS OFTEN ANALYZED USING THE SAME THEORETICAL MODELS OF TRADITIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP. WITH THE PRESENT STUDY, WE HAVE ATTEMPTED TO OVERCOME THIS PROBLEM BY ANALYZING DIFFERENT ANTECEDENTS, CLOSER TO THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL UNIVERSE, AND DETACHED FROM A MALE-CENTRIC AND TRADITIONAL VISION OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WITH THE AIM OF UNDERSTANDING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS IN HIGHER EDUCATION. RESULTS OBTAINED FROM A SAMPLE OF 962 COLLEGE STUDENTS SHOWED THAT PRIOR EXPERIENCE WITH SOCIAL PROBLEMS (PESP) AND EMPATHY (EMP) HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE IMPACT ON SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION (SEI). FURTHERMORE, SOCIAL SELF-EFFICACY (SES-E), MORAL OBLIGATION (MO), AND PERCEIVED SOCIAL SUPPORT (PSS), IN ADDITION TO DIRECTLY INFLUENCING SEI, MEDIATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN PESP-SEI, AND THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMP-SEI. MORE INTERESTINGLY, GENDER (MALE VS FEMALE), BUT NOT THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF STUDY (SOCIAL SCIENCES VS ECONOMICS AND BUSINESS SCIENCES), MODERATED THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EMP-SEI TO THE BENEFIT OF WOMEN. GIVEN THE IMPORTANCE OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CRISIS, THESE ARE IMPORTANT RESULTS BECAUSE, ON THE ONE HAND, THEY MAKE IT POSSIBLE TO OVERCOME THE MALE-FEMALE GAP THAT CHARACTERIZES TRADITIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, ON THE OTHER, THEY UNDERLINE THE NEED TO INTRODUCE DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTS CLOSER TO THE SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL SPHERE INTO ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION PROGRAMS. © 2023 THE AUTHOR(S).

IN DISCUSSING ENTREPRENEURIAL LEARNING OF ENTREPRENEURS WHO ARE IN MOTHERHOOD, ALSO KNOWN AS MUMPRENEURS, THESE STUDIES REQUIRE THE CONSIDERATION OF GENDER DISTINCTION OF WOMEN. THE TERM “MUMPRENEURS” REFERS TO WOMEN WHO EMBRACE THE IDENTITY OF A MOTHER AND AN ENTREPRENEUR, AND THESE TWO IDENTITIES ENGENDER ROLE CONFLICTS FOR THEM. THUS, THIS PHENOMENOLOGY STUDY EXPLORED SEVEN MUMPRENEURS' EXPERIENCES OF THEIR STRUGGLES AND STRATEGIES TO SURVIVE THE PANDEMIC. THE FINDINGS SHED LIGHT ON THE PANDEMIC IMPACTS AND PERSEVERANCE EXPERIENCES THAT MUMPRENEURS MUST WITHSTAND TO MANEUVER THE ENCOUNTERED CHALLENGES. THIS STUDY PRESENTS AN ENTREPRENEURIAL LEARNING FRAMEWORK FOR MUMPRENEURS BY PROVIDING PEDAGOGICAL GUIDANCE AND INSPIRATION TO ENABLE THEM CRUISE PAST FUTURE CRISIS ENVIRONMENTS.

INTELLECT. CAP.,"PURPOSE: THE CURRENT RESEARCH PROPOSES A MODEL THAT INTEGRATES CERTAIN PSYCHOLOGICAL AND DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS IN DEVELOPING AND STRENGTHENING YOUNG SAUDI WOMEN'S PERCEPTIONS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL RESOURCEFULNESS, WHICH EVENTUALLY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS. THE STUDY ALSO EXAMINES THE WAYS IN WHICH CHANGING SOCIO-CULTURAL NORMS AND VALUES MAY AUGMENT INVESTMENTS AND/OR EFFORTS TO ENHANCE COGNITIVE ENABLERS, INCLUDING ENTREPRENEURIAL RESOURCEFULNESS, AND THEREBY BUILD AND STRENGTHEN ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS AMONG FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS (I.E. HUMAN CAPITAL) IN A TRANSITIONING SOCIETY. SAUDI ARABIA IS A RELEVANT RESEARCH CONTEXT BECAUSE THE SAUDI GOVERNMENT HAS INVESTED ENORMOUS RESOURCES TO DEVELOP THE COUNTRY'S HUMAN CAPITAL, PARTICULARLY SAUDI GOVERNMENT INTENDS TO ENHANCE SAUDI WOMEN'S PARTICIPATION IN ENTREPRENEURIAL SPHERES TO BE ENHANCED SIGNIFICANTLY. SAUDI ARABIA IS UNDERGOING A RADICAL SOCIO-CULTURAL TRANSITION, AND THE KINGDOM SEEKS TO CAPITALISE ON THIS ONGOING TRANSFORMATION TO FURTHER ENCOURAGE WOMEN TO TAP INTO THEIR UNDER-UTILISED POTENTIAL. THIS STUDY SEEKS TO CORROBORATE SUCH MODERATION EFFECTS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE AUTHORS UTILISE THE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL (IC) FRAMEWORK AND THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR (TBP) TO PROPOSE THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL IN THIS STUDY. USING A SAMPLE OF 628 YOUNG FEMALE RESPONDENTS – POTENTIAL ENTREPRENEURS STUDYING AT VARIOUS UNIVERSITIES IN SAUDI ARABIA, THE AUTHORS TEST THE HYPOTHESISED ASSOCIATIONS THROUGH PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES (PLS)-BASED PATH MODELLING. FINDINGS: THE AUTHORS FOUND A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE IMPACT OF PSYCHOLOGICAL FACTORS, SUCH AS PERCEIVED BEHAVIOURAL CONTROL, ATTITUDE TOWARDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SUBJECTIVE NORMS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY, ON THE DEVELOPMENT AND ENHANCEMENT OF PERCEIVED ENTREPRENEURIAL RESOURCEFULNESS. IN ADDITION, DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS, INCLUDING FAMILY INCOME, FAMILY BACKGROUND, FAMILY BUSINESS EXPERIENCE AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, PLAY A SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE ROLE IN ENHANCING INDIVIDUALS' ENTREPRENEURIAL RESOURCEFULNESS PERCEPTIONS. THE AUTHORS FURTHER FOUND THAT ENHANCED PERCEPTIONS OF PERCEIVED ENTREPRENEURIAL RESOURCEFULNESS DEVELOP AND ENHANCE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS AMONG FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. HOWEVER, THE TRANSFORMATION IN SOCIAL AND CULTURAL NORMS SIGNIFICANTLY MODERATES THIS CAUSE AND EFFECT RELATIONSHIP. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY IS AMONG THE FIRST OF ITS KIND TO INVESTIGATE THE MODERATING EFFECTS OF SOCIAL AND CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION ON EFFORTS AND/OR INVESTMENTS TO ENHANCE INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL (MORE SPECIFICALLY, HUMAN CAPITAL) AND THEREBY PROMOTE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. THE STUDY IS ALSO VALUABLE FOR ITS FOCUS ON A UNIQUE CONTEXT, I.E. FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND, MORE SPECIFICALLY, SAUDI ARABIA. THE STUDY OFFERS USEFUL INSIGHTS AND IMPLICATIONS BOTH FOR THEORY AND PRACTICE, PARTICULARLY FOR POLICYMAKERS SEEKING TO AUGMENT THEIR INTELLECTUAL CAPITAL FORMATION EFFORTS THROUGH AN EFFECTIVE ORCHESTRATION OF SOCIO-CULTURAL TRANSFORMATION, WHICH SEEKS TO EMPOWER FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS TO SUCCEED IN THE FACE OF SIGNIFICANT SOCIO-CULTURAL IMPEDIMENTS. © 2022, EMERALD PUBLISHING LIMITED.",NA,"S.

TO UNDERSTAND THE DYNAMICS OF TRANSITIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP, A THEMATIC REVIEW, A QUALITATIVE RESEARCH TOOL, WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE RESEARCH PROBLEM AND PROVIDE ANSWERS TO THE RESEARCH QUESTIONS. THREE INSIGHTFUL FINDINGS EMERGED FROM THE THEMATIC REVIEW. FIRST, SIX BROAD THEMES EMERGED AS CATALYSTS FOR TRANSITIONAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP AMONG THE THREE FOCUSED ENTREPRENEURS, NAMELY, THE INSTITUTIONAL ENVIRONMENT, PUSH FACTORS, PULL FACTORS, ETHNIC RESOURCE DEPENDENCE, CULTURAL INHERITANCE, AND GENDER IDENTITY ISSUES. SPECIFIC ELEMENTS OF EACH OF THE SIX THEMES ARE EXPLICATED. MOREOVER, TWO LEVELS OF UNCERTAINTY (LEVELS 1 AND 2) CONFRONT TRANSITIONAL ENTREPRENEURS DEPENDING ON COUNTRIES AND INSTITUTIONAL CONTEXTS. LEVEL 1 UNCERTAINTY PRESENTS A CLEAR FUTURE WITH LIKELIHOODS, POSSIBILITIES, AND PROBABILITIES OF SUCCESS, WHILE LEVEL 2 UNCERTAINTY PRESENTS SEVERAL ALTERNATE PATHS AND TRAJECTORIES WITH A BLURRED POSSIBILITY OF SUCCESS FOR THESE ENTREPRENEURS. FINALLY, TRANSITIONAL ENTREPRENEURS LEVERAGE OPTIONED AND ADAPTIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP STRATEGIES IN DIFFERENT WAYS TO COPE WITH THE TWO TYPES OF UNCERTAINTY IN THEIR HOST COUNTRIES.

MOREOVER, THERE IS ALSO A LACK OF WOMEN IN TECH ENTREPRENEURSHIP; MOST SUCCESS STORIES ARE ABOUT MALE ENTREPRENEURS, AND IN SILICON VALLEY THE TERM DESCRIBING THE START-UP CULTURE IS CALLED “TECH BROS” FOR A REASON. OBJECTIVE: THIS PAPER IDENTIFIES DIFFERENT FACTORS AFFECTING THE WOMEN'S DECISION TO SELECT A TECH SECTOR AND BECOME AN ENTREPRENEUR IN THE TECH SECTOR. IN THIS PAPER WE ALSO AIM TO IDENTIFY DIFFERENT PITFALLS AND PROBLEMS, WHICH COULD INFLUENCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF THE TECH SECTOR, AND SPECIFICALLY TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP, TOWARDS THE WOMEN INTERESTED IN THE SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, AND ENGINEERING DOMAINS. METHOD: TO STUDY THE FACTORS AFFECTING WOMEN'S INTEREST TOWARDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR, WE CONDUCTED A SERIES OF SURVEYS AND INTERVIEWS TO UNDERSTAND THE UNDERLYING PHENOMENA. OVERALL, THIS STUDY INTERVIEWED TEN FEMALE COMPANY FOUNDERS, AND CONDUCTED TWO SURVEYS WITH WOMEN WORKING, INTERESTED, OR STUDYING TOWARDS THE TECH SECTOR, ALLOWING US TO COMBINE AND COMPARE THE QUALITATIVE DATA FROM THE WOMEN WHO HAD BECOME ENTREPRENEURS AGAINST THE QUANTITATIVE TRENDS AND IDEAS COLLECTED FROM THE GENERAL AUDIENCES. RESULTS: THE MOST COMMON FACTORS LIMITING THE INDIVIDUALS’ INTEREST TOWARDS ENTREPRENEURSHIP SUCH AS FINANCIAL RISKS OR HIGH RESPONSIBILITIES MIGHT NOT BE GENDER-RELATED, BUT THERE ARE ALSO ASPECTS AS SOCIAL ACCEPTANCE, DISCRIMINATION, AND LACK OF ROLE MODELS, WHICH AFFECT ESPECIALLY THE WOMEN INTERESTED IN THE POSSIBILITIES OF BECOMING AN ENTREPRENEUR IN TECH. CONCLUSIONS: IN GENERAL, THE CURRENT YOUNGER GENERATIONS ARE AWARE OF THE OPTION OF BECOMING ENTREPRENEURS, AND WHAT BECOMING ONE REQUIRES. INITIATIVES, SUCH AS ADDING POSITIVE EXAMPLES OF FEMALES’ SUCCESS, OR SUPPORTING ENTRY-LEVEL OPPORTUNITIES TOWARDS FULL-TIME ENTREPRENEURSHIP, COULD HAVE A MEANINGFUL IMPACT OF REDUCING THE GENDER IMBALANCE IN THE STEM FIELDS, AND IN TECHNOLOGY ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN GENERAL. © 2022 THE AUTHOR(S)",ISOTE,"J.

THUS, MORE RESEARCH IS NEEDED TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW EFFECTIVE MICROFINANCE IS IN ACHIEVING POVERTY REDUCTION, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, AND FINANCIAL INCLUSION. THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE LITERATURE BY RELYING ON A UNIQUE DATASET FROM ONE OF THE BIGGEST FINTECH COMPANIES IN BRAZIL TO STUDY THE IMPACT OF MICROCREDIT ON SMALL FIRMS’ OUTCOMES. USING A DIFFERENCE-IN-DIFFERENCE APPROACH, WE FIND THAT ACCESS TO CREDIT INCREASES MONTHLY REVENUES AND PROFITS BY NEARLY 4.5%. WE SHOW THAT THE EFFECTS ARE STRONGER FOR WOMEN-LED BUSINESSES AND LESS EXPERIENCED ENTREPRENEURS. IN ADDITION, WE FIND THAT CREDIT RENEWAL STRENGTHENS THE BENEFITS OF CREDIT ACCESS. WE DISCUSS SEVERAL POLICY IMPLICATIONS FROM OUR RESULTS. IN PARTICULAR, THE PERMANENT AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT – AS OPPOSED TO ONE-TIME/SHORT-TERM INTERVENTIONS – HAS GREATER POTENTIAL TO GENERATE VIRTUOUS CYCLES OF EVER MORE REINVESTMENT AND GROWTH, INDICATING LARGER GAINS FROM RELAXING BORROWING CONSTRAINTS IN THE LONG RUN. © 2023",JPMOD,"M.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: NECESSITY (NEC) AND OPPORTUNITY (OPP) MOTIVATION IS USED AS THE GUIDING THEORY TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE CONTRARIES OF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURIAL MOTIVATION. FEMALE ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCY (FEC) FRAMEWORK IS USED AS A BASIS FOR WEC. EMBEDDED IN THIS REASONING, MTL AND FECS ARE INTEGRATED INTO THE CONCEPTUAL MODEL TO UNDERSTAND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN START-UP MOTIVATION AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AMONG WES IN A DEVELOPING ECONOMY. FINDINGS: TO DATE, THERE IS A LIMITED UNDERSTANDING OF HOW LEARNING MOTIVATION AND COMPETENCIES TOGETHER EXPLAIN THE BUSINESS PERFORMANCE OF WES THROUGH THE LENS OF THEIR DIFFERENCES IN START-UP MOTIVATION. IN THIS RESPECT, THIS CONCEPTUAL MODEL ADVANCES SCHOLARLY INSIGHTS BY CONCEPTUALIZING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NEC AND OPP MOTIVATION, AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE MEDIATING INFLUENCES OF MTL AND WECS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY ASPECTS OTHER THAN ENTREPRENEURIAL MOTIVATION, LEARNING MOTIVATION AND COMPETENCIES RELATED TO BUSINESS PERFORMANCE SUCH AS ACCESS TO FINANCE, SOCIOCULTURAL ASPECTS AND PERSONALITY TRAITS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE PROPOSED CONCEPTUAL MODEL CAN CONTRIBUTE TO ACADEMICS BY ADDING TO THE BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. IT CAN ALSO AID POLICYMAKERS IN UNDERSTANDING THE CRITICAL LINK BETWEEN DIFFERENTIALS IN START-UP MOTIVATION AND FIRM PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE MEDIATING INFLUENCES OF LEARNING MOTIVATION AND COMPETENCIES, THUS POTENTIALLY PROVIDING A BASIS FOR FORMULATING FOCUSED SKILLING STRATEGIES FOR WES.

MANAGE. DEV.,"PURPOSE: THIS PAPER USES THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR (TPB) TO EXPLAIN ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS (EIS) AMONG STUDENTS FROM DIFFERENT SOUTH-EAST (SE) EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, CONSIDERING VARIOUS PERSONAL AND SITUATIONAL VARIABLES. THE AUTHORS EXAMINE HOW THE REGIONAL CULTURAL CONTEXT AFFECTS INDIVIDUAL PERCEPTIONS AND BELIEFS ABOUT ENTREPRENEURSHIP, WHICH IN TURN FORM THE BASIS OF THE COGNITIVE ANTECEDENTS OF THE TPB MODEL. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: USING A SAMPLE OF 850 RESPONDENTS, THE AUTHORS ESTIMATE A TWO-LEVEL MODEL, ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF ENDOGENEITY IN THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ATTITUDES AND BELIEFS AND THE RESPONDENTS' EI. SPECIFICALLY, THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON HETEROGENEITY ACROSS NATIONS IN ATTITUDES TOWARD ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR (ATEB), SUBJECTIVE NORMS (SN) AND PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL CONTROL (PBC). FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL CONTROL AND THE ATTITUDE TOWARD ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR ARE THE MAIN DETERMINANTS OF BALKAN STUDENTS' EI. THE AUTHORS FIND THAT THE ROLE OF SE EUROPEAN CULTURE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP INTENTIONS DOES NOT FOLLOW THE WESTERN PATTERN. IN THIS PARTICULAR REGIONAL ENVIRONMENT DOMINATED BY COLLECTIVIST CULTURE, STUDENTS' EIS ARE INFLUENCED MORE BY COOPERATION, CARING FOR OTHERS AND OTHER NON-MONETARY BENEFITS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: LIKE ANY STUDY, THIS STUDY HAS LIMITATIONS. FIRST, ALL THE VARIABLES WERE MEASURED USING A SINGLE QUESTIONNAIRE. ALTHOUGH COMMON METHOD BIAS WAS SHOWN NOT TO BE AN ISSUE, IN FUTURE RESEARCH DIFFERENT VARIABLES SHOULD BE MEASURED WITH DIFFERENT METHODS. FOR INSTANCE, USING THE ITEMS BY LIÑÁN AND CHEN (2009) WHICH WERE DEVELOPED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, TO MEASURE SE EUROPEAN STUDENTS' ENTREPRENEURIAL PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL CONTROL MIGHT IGNORE SOME REQUISITE RESOURCES OR ABILITIES TYPICAL FOR SE EUROPEAN STUDENTS, SUCH AS PERSONAL RELATIONAL NETWORK (SIMILAR TO THE NOTION OF GUANXI IN CHINA (SEE, E.G. HWANG ET AL., 2009). SECOND, BUSENITZ ET AL. (2000) INDICATE THAT CROSS-NATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP ARE BEST EXPLAINED BY A BROADER SET OF INSTITUTIONS, I.E. EDUCATIONAL AND GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT AGENCIES. IN GENERAL, THE EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN NATIONAL CULTURE AND ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR IS MIXED AND THIS IS GENERALLY AGREED THAT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED IS THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN CULTURAL VALUES, SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS, INDUSTRY CHARACTERISTICS AND OUTCOMES SUCH AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP (HAYTON ET AL., 2002). IN THE FUTURE, SIMILAR STUDIES COULD INCLUDE RESPONDENTS WITH A LARGER DISPERSION OF PRIOR EDUCATION, AGE, AND HUMAN, SOCIAL AND FINANCIAL CAPITAL. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE EXISTENCE OF SUPPORT RECEIVED IN THE FAMILY ENVIRONMENT AND THE LACK OF INDIVIDUALISTIC AND COMPETITIVE ASPIRATIONS CREATE A MORE FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR A YOUNG PERSON TO BECOME ENTREPRENEUR. THIS MUST BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY INTO ACCOUNT BY EDUCATORS AND POLICY MAKERS AIMING AT ENCOURAGING ENTREPRENEURSHIP, BECAUSE IN THE SOCIETIES STUDIED HERE THE MOTIVATION OF PROSPECTIVE ENTREPRENEURS DEPENDS ON TOTALLY DIFFERENT DRIVERS THAN THOSE USUALLY ENCOUNTERED IN THE WESTERN WORLD. FURTHERMORE, FROM A GENDER PERSPECTIVE, THE AUTHORS' STUDY SUGGESTS THAT IN SOCIETIES WITH STRONGER FAMILY TIES AND MORE GENDER DISCRIMINATION, AN INDIVIDUAL'S CLOSER SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT MAY NOT CREATE THE APPROPRIATE CONTEXT FOR WOMEN TO DECIDE TO BECOME ENTREPRENEURS. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: A STRONG HIERARCHICAL CULTURE IN A SOCIETY GOES AGAINST THE INTENTION OF BECOMING AN ENTREPRENEUR. THAT IS, WHEN PEOPLE ACCEPT THAT SOCIAL MOBILITY IS LOW AND, THUS, REVERSING PEOPLE'S RELATIVE POSITIONS IN THE SOCIETY IS UNLIKELY, PEOPLE ARE LESS PRONE TO BECOMING ENTREPRENEURS. IN WESTERN SOCIETIES, WHERE COLLECTIVISM IS LOW, THE CONTRARY HOLDS. IN THE SOCIETIES CONSIDERED HERE, WHERE FAMILY AND SOCIAL LINKS ARE STRONG, ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS CONSIDERED TO BE A RATHER SAFER OPTION, WHICH IS ENCOURAGED BY NON-INDIVIDUALISTIC VALUES AND IS NEGATIVELY ASSOCIATED WITH AGGRESSIVE COMPETITIVENESS. IN THOSE SOCIETIES, FORMAL INSTITUTIONS SUCH AS THE GOVERNMENT AND THE EDUCATIONAL SECTOR COULD PLAY AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO SUPPORT PROSPECTIVE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS (BORGES ET AL., 2021).

THIS HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF WOMEN-OWNED SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES (SMES) AND THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS. THEREFORE, THE CURRENT STUDY EXTENDS THE ENTREPRENEURSHIP LITERATURE BY EXAMINING THE EFFECTS OF FACTORS LIKE PERSONALITY TRAITS (PT), MOTIVATION AND COMMITMENT (MC), AVAILABILITY OF FINANCIAL RESOURCES (AFR), AND GOVERNMENT SUPPORT (GS) ON ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS (ES) OF WOMEN-OWNED SMES. USING A PURPOSIVE SAMPLING TECHNIQUE DATA FROM 255 WOMEN-OWNED SMES WERE COLLECTED. A MULTI-ANALYTICAL APPROACH WAS EMPLOYED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING (SEM) RESULTS INDICATED THAT PT, MC, AFR, AND GS HAVE A DIRECT EFFECT OF ES WHEREAS MC ALSO MEDIATED THE LINK BETWEEN PT AND ES, AND THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT IN PRESENCE OF MC THE EFFECTS OF PT ON ES BECOME MORE SIGNIFICANT. SEM RESULTS REVEALED THAT PT AND AFR ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS RELATED TO ENTREPRENEURIAL SUCCESS. ON THE CONTRARY, ANN ANALYSIS REVEALED THAT “MOTIVATION AND COMMITMENT” IS THE MOST INFLUENCING FACTOR.

ADV. NURS.,"AIM: TO UNDERSTAND SELF-EMPLOYED LONG-TERM-CARE WORKERS' EXPERIENCES OF PRECARIOUSNESS, AND TO UNRAVEL HOW THEIR EXPERIENCES ARE SHAPED AT THE INTERSECTION OF GENDER, CLASS, RACE, MIGRATION AND AGE. BACKGROUND: IN THE NETHERLANDS, INCREASING NUMBERS OF NURSES AND NURSING AIDES IN LONG-TERM CARE (LTC) OPT FOR SELF-EMPLOYMENT. SOCIETAL ORGANIZATIONS AND POLICY MAKERS EXPRESS CONCERNS ABOUT THIS DEVELOPMENT, AS SELF-EMPLOYMENT IS SEEN AS A RISK FACTOR FOR POOR HEALTH. SELF-EMPLOYMENT IS NOT NECESSARILY PRECARIOUS WORK BUT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO THE PRECARIOUSNESS OF SPECIFIC GROUPS. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT INEQUITIES AMONG SELF-EMPLOYED NURSES AND NURSING AIDES IN LONG-TERM CARE IS LACKING. DESIGN: A PARTICIPATORY, QUALITATIVE INTERVIEW STUDY. THE RESEARCH TEAM CONSISTED OF FOUR ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS AND FIVE (UN)PAID CARE WORKERS. METHODS: SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WITH 23 SELF-EMPLOYED NURSES AND NURSING AIDES IN LTC (2019–2020). DATA WERE ANALYSED FROM AN INTERSECTIONAL PERSPECTIVE. RESULTS: FIRST, WE DESCRIBE THAT FEELING PRECARIOUS AS A HIRED EMPLOYEE—DUE TO INCREASING WORKLOADS, HEALTH RISKS, POVERTY AND DISCRIMINATION—SHAPES CARE WORKERS' CHOICE FOR SELF-EMPLOYMENT. SECOND, WE DESCRIBE INEQUITIES BETWEEN SELF-EMPLOYED CARE WORKERS WHO COULD (FINANCIALLY) AFFORD TO TURN TO SELF-EMPLOYMENT AS A HEALTH STRATEGY AND THOSE WHO FELT SQUEEZED OUT OF THE ORGANIZATIONS DUE TO POVERTY OR DISCRIMINATION. THEY MORE OFTEN DEALT WITH PRECARIOUS WORK IN THE CONTEXT OF PRECARIOUS LIVES, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THEIR HEALTH. THIRD, WE DESCRIBE HOW NEGOTIATING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL IDENTITY WITH A CARING IDENTITY REQUIRED MATERIAL SACRIFICES AND THUS CONTRIBUTED TO SELF-EMPLOYED CARE WORKERS' FINANCIAL PRECARIOUSNESS, PARTICULARLY AS WOMEN. CONCLUSION: OUR FINDINGS INDICATE THAT WORKING IN LTC IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY PRECARIOUS FOR ALL CARE WORKERS, BOTH FOR HIRED AND SELF-EMPLOYED, WITH YOUNGER, LOWER-PAID AND RACIALIZED WOMEN WITH UNPAID CARING RESPONSIBILITIES SEEMINGLY MOST AT RISK FOR PRECARIOUSNESS. IMPACT: OUR FINDINGS URGE POLICY MAKERS AND CARE ORGANIZATIONS TO DEVELOP GENDER AND DIVERSITY-SENSITIVE POLICY RESPONSES TO ADDRESS THESE INEQUITIES. © 2022 THE AUTHORS.

REV.,"PURPOSE: THIS RESEARCH AIMS TO INVESTIGATE THE FEASIBILITY OF FORMALIZING AN OLD, INFORMAL LIVESTOCK FINANCING PRACTICE IN PAKISTAN KNOWN AS ADHYARA THROUGH ASSESSMENT OF ESTIMATED RETURN AND RISK. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE HEDONIC PRICING MODEL WAS EMPLOYED TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF BREED, WEIGHT, PREGNANCY STATUS AND MILK YIELD ON CATTLE SALES PRICE, AND APPROPRIATE ESTIMATES WERE USED FOR MONETIZATION. THE STOCHASTIC SIMULATION WAS THEN USED TO ESTIMATE THE DISTRIBUTION OF CAPITAL RETURNS FOR INVESTORS IN THE INFORMAL LIVESTOCK PRACTICE. PRIMARY DATA ON ANIMAL PRICES AND ATTRIBUTES WERE OBTAINED FROM A SURVEY OF DAIRY FARMS AND DATA ON TERMS OF ADHYARA DEAL WERE OBTAINED FROM A SURVEY OF NOMAD PASTORALISTS AND CURRENT INVESTORS. IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WERE ALSO CONDUCTED WITH DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS TO GET INSIGHTS INTO THIS INFORMAL LIVESTOCK PRACTICE AND SOCIAL ELEMENTS. FINDINGS: RESULTS FROM THE HEDONIC MODEL SHOW THAT THE ANIMAL PRICES IN PAKISTAN ARE HIGHLY VARIABLE DEPENDING ON THE ANIMAL ATTRIBUTES OF BREED, WEIGHT, MILK YIELD AND PREGNANCY STATUS WITH AN AVERAGE VALUE OF PKR (PAKISTANI RUPEE) 191,771 AND STANDARD DEVIATION OF PKR 66,762. OUR STOCHASTIC SIMULATION REVEALS MEAN ESTIMATED REAL RETURN OF 24 PER CENT. THIS RETURN IS COMPETITIVE CONSIDERING LOCAL AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THE RESEARCH IDENTIFIES A LUCRATIVE AND MARKET COMPETITIVE INVESTMENT OPTION AND THUS OPENS THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY TO INTRODUCE GRASS ROOT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN THE LIVESTOCK SECTOR. RECOMMENDED FORMALIZATION OF THIS TRADITIONAL LIVESTOCK PRACTICE CAN BOOST INVESTMENT CREATING SUBSTANTIAL POTENTIAL FOR THE UPLIFT OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE GOALS OF POVERTY ERADICATION, FOOD PROVISION AND EMPLOYMENT GENERATION FOR WOMEN.

FINDINGS: THE KEY FINDING AMONG ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS WAS THE IMPORTANCE OF GRIT, WHICH ACCORDING TO THEM, MADE THE ULTIMATE DIFFERENCE IN THEIR SUCCESS. GRIT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSTRUCT THAT WE SHOULD SCRUTINIZE, BECAUSE IT WAS DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE PROFOUND EFFECTS ON THE RESPONDENTS.

RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IS ASSOCIATED WITH PERCEPTIONS OF TRUSTWORTHINESS, RULE-FOLLOWING, AND ETHICALITY—QUALITIES THAT WOULD SUGGEST AN ENTREPRENEUR WOULD LIKELY AVOID OPPORTUNIST BEHAVIOR AND REPAY THE LOAN. HOWEVER, APPEALS TO A HIGHER POWER MAY BE INCONGRUENT WITH THE ROLE OF AN ENTREPRENEUR TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH EXPRESSION COMMUNICATES A LACK OF PROACTIVENESS AND SELF-RELIANCE. WE USE A TWO-STUDY DESIGN TO HELP RESOLVE THIS TENSION. OUR FIELD STUDY INCORPORATING 253,130 LOANS FROM KIVA REVEALS THAT RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION NEGATIVELY INFLUENCES FUNDING, PARTICULARLY FOR WOMEN. OUR EXPERIMENT USING 1,795 INDIVIDUAL LOAN ASSESSMENTS SHOWS THAT THE NEGATIVE INFLUENCE OF RELIGIOUS EXPRESSION IS ATTENUATED WHEN INDIVIDUAL LENDERS EXHIBIT HIGHER LEVELS OF RELIGIOSITY.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: USING DATA FROM THE GLOBAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP MONITOR’S SPECIAL REPORT “WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP 2020/21: THRIVING THROUGH CRISIS” FOR 43 COUNTRIES, THIS STUDY USES FUZZY-SET QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE ANALYSIS TO ASSESS COMPLEX CAUSAL CONDITIONS. FINDINGS: RESULTS REVEALED SIX DIFFERENT CAUSAL CONFIGURATIONS LEADING TO HIGH FEMALE EA AND THE SAME NUMBER LEADING TO HIGH MALE EA DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC. ALTHOUGH HALF OF THESE CONFIGURATIONS ARE GENDER SPECIFIC, THIS STUDY FOUND SEVERAL SIMILARITIES IN THE COMPLEX CONDITIONS LEADING TO THE SAME OUTCOME FOR WOMEN AND MEN.

THIS THEME IS A RELATIVELY NEW PHENOMENON IN SLOVAKIA, AND THAT IS THE AUTHOR’S MAIN CONTRIBUTION. THE RESEARCH WAS CONDUCTED USING AN ONLINE QUESTIONNAIRE ADMINISTERED BETWEEN MAY AND JULY 2022 IN EACH DISTRICT OF THE REGION, WITH A TOTAL OF 283 RESPONDENTS PARTICIPATING. THE RESULTS OBTAINED FROM THE QUESTIONNAIRE SURVEY WERE STATISTICALLY PROCESSED USING PEARSON’S CORRELATION COEFFICIENT. WE USED STATISTIC 109 SOFTWARE (TIBCO SOFTWARE, PALO ALTO, CALIFORNIA).

SINCE THE MAJORITY OF RURAL POOR PEOPLE CANNOT AFFORD TO RAISE LARGE RUMINANTS, THEY HAVE HEAVILY DEPENDED ON RAISING SMALL RUMINANTS, SUCH AS GOATS, TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR LIVELIHOODS. THE OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO CLARIFY THE CURRENT SOCIO-ECONOMIC STATUS WITH THE VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS FACED BY GOAT FARMERS, MANAGEMENT PRACTICES, AND THE COMMON DISEASE FREQUENCY OF GOATS IN THE NORTHERN PART OF BANGLADESH. SURVEY DATA WERE COLLECTED FROM A TOTAL OF 398 GOAT FARMERS IN DIFFERENT VILLAGES IN THE PANCHAGARH, JAMALPUR, AND KURIGRAM DISTRICTS OF BANGLADESH. SURVEY DATA INDICATED THAT 57.0 % OF WOMEN FARMERS ARE INVOLVED WITH GOAT REARING. THE STUDY FOUND THAT 40.5 % OF GOAT FARMERS HAD 1–5 YEARS’ OF EXPERIENCE IN FARMING GOATS. THE DATA SHOWED THAT 36.9 % OF FARMER'S INCOME WAS < 10,000 BDT PER YEAR (1 $USD= 96 BDT) WHILE 52.5 % OF GOAT FARMERS EARNED BETWEEN 10,000 AND 20,000 BDT PER YEAR AND 10.6 % OF FARMERS EARN > 20,000 BDT PER YEAR. MOST OF THE FARMERS (67.3 %) REARED GOATS IN THE SEMI-INTENSIVE SYSTEM, BUT FEW FARMERS (8.5 %) USED AN INTENSIVE REARING SYSTEM AND 24.1 % OF FARMERS USED A FREE-RANGE SYSTEM. THE SEMI-INTENSIVE SYSTEM WAS MOST PREVALENT, 50.8 % OF FARMERS USED CONSTRUCTED SEPARATE NIGHT SHELTERS, AND 59.8 % USED GOAT HOUSES MADE OF CORRUGATED STEEL SHEETS. THE MAJORITY OF FARMERS USED EARTHEN FLOORING (61.8 %), AND 47.5 % USED STRAW FOR BEDS. 34.2 % OF FARMERS WHOLLY PASTURE-FED THEIR GOATS, 30.2 % OF FARMERS SUPPLIED GRASS WITH CONCENTRATE, AND 53.8 % OF FARMERS PRACTICED GRAZING TIME OF 5–8 H. THE MAJORITY (83.7 %) OF FARMERS DID NOT USE VACCINES, 67.3 % DID NOT USE ANTHELMINTICS, AND 85.7 % OF FARMERS TREATED THEIR GOATS WITH NATIVE QUACK MEDICINE. THE RESEARCH FOUND THAT COMMON DISEASES PREVALENT IN THE GOAT SUCH AS PPR (49.2 %), DIARRHEA (55.3 %), ACIDOSIS (38.7 %), NAVEL ILL (29.6 %), MYIASIS (27.4 %), UROLITHIASIS (26.9 %) AND WOUNDS (34.2 %). THE PREVALENCE OF DIARRHEA AND ACIDOSIS IN GOAT FARMS WERE SHOWN TO BE A SIGNIFICANT ASSOCIATION WITH THE TYPE OF HOUSE AND REARING PERSON (P < 0.05), RESPECTIVELY, BY UNIVARIATE ASSOCIATION OF FARM PRACTICES AND COMMON DISEASES. IN THE STUDY, ALL OF THE GOAT FARMERS WERE FACED WITH DIFFERENT CONSTRAINTS, THE MAIN CONSTRAINTS WERE DETERMINED TO BE COMPLAINTS FROM NEIGHBORS (RANK I), A LACK OF GREEN FODDER (RANK II), AND A LACK OF PUREBRED BUCKS (RANK III). IT IS CONCLUDED THAT THE SOCIO-ECONOMIC SITUATION WAS POOR AND THAT THE FARMERS DID NOT PAY MUCH ATTENTION TO THE REARING SYSTEM AND HEALTHCARE (INCLUDING ANTHELMINTICS, VACCINATIONS, AND VETERINARY SERVICES). TO INCREASE INCOME FOR FARMERS, THEY REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF PROLIFIC GOAT BREEDS, BREEDING, REARING SYSTEMS, FEEDING, HEALTH CARE, HYGIENE AND SANITATION, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN, BUSINESS STRATEGY, FINANCIAL INCENTIVES, AND KNOWLEDGE OF MARKETING.

IN THIS STUDY, WE DRAW FROM THE POWER LAW PERSPECTIVE TO SUGGEST THAT THESE FINDINGS PRIMARILY ORIGINATE FROM THE WAY RESEARCHERS TREAT THE OUTLIERS, THOSE OBSERVATIONS FAR FROM THE NORMAL. WE HYPOTHESIZE THAT THE BEST OF THE BEST (I.E., THE ROCK STAR) FOUNDERS AND VENTURES OF EACH GENDER WILL HAVE EQUALLY STELLAR PERFORMANCE. CONTRARY TO THE MAJORITY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP STUDIES THAT CONSIDER OUTLIERS AS ‘‘PROBLEMS’’ THAT MUST BE REMOVED OR TRANSFORMED, THE POWER LAW PERSPECTIVE ASSUMES THAT OUTLIERS ARE DIFFERENT, HAVE DIFFERENTIAL EFFECTS BY SKEWING DISTRIBUTIONS FAR TO THE RIGHT, AND ARE LIKELY THE MOST INTERESTING AND INFLUENTIAL CASES IN THE POPULATION. WE LEVERAGE SEMI-PARAMETRIC METHODS ON LONGITUDINAL DATA FROM A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF NASCENT ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURES TO DEMONSTRATE THE GENDER EFFECT ON OUTLIER VS. NON-OUTLIER CATEGORIES. OUR FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT GENDER DOES, IN FACT, NEGATIVELY AFFECT NON-OUTLIERS (I.E., “AVERAGE” ENTREPRENEURS), WHILE HAVING NO IMPACT ON OUTLIERS. WE SHOW THAT COMPARED TO THE MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION, THOSE WITH OUTLIER INPUTS—RESOURCE ENDOWMENTS, EXPECTATIONS FOR FUTURE GROWTH, AND ENGAGEMENT—HAVE A GREATER LIKELIHOOD OF ACHIEVING OUTLIER OUTCOMES, REGARDLESS OF THEIR GENDER.

SCI.,"RECENT REPORTS HIGHLIGHTED A WORRYING TREND IN MALAYSIA WHERE THE NUMBER OF FEMALE GRADUATES HAS INCREASED BUT AT THE SAME TIME THERE IS A LOWER NUMBER OF FEMALE WORKERS. PARTICULARLY, IN 2022, MOST UNEMPLOYED GRADUATES ARE WOMEN, ACCOUNTING FOR 54.2% OF THE TOTAL, ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF STATISTICS MALAYSIA (DOSM). THIS INCREASES THE GENDER GAP IN THE WORKFORCE AND SUBSEQUENTLY DECREASES FEMALE PARTICIPATION TOWARDS NATION-BUILDING AND ECONOMIC GROWTH. MEANWHILE, STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT INCLUSIVITY CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE REDUCTION OF UNEMPLOYMENT RATES AND INCREASE RE-EMPLOYMENT. THUS, THIS STUDY SUGGESTS THAT “INCLUSIVE ENTREPRENEURSHIP” CAN BE A VIABLE SOLUTION TO THE PROBLEM OBSERVED, AS ENTREPRENEURSHIP MIGHT BE A MORE ATTRACTIVE OPTION THAN EMPLOYMENT FOR FEMALE GRADUATES. THIS PAPER AIMS TO EXPLORE THE FACTORS INFLUENCING INCLUSIVE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION AMONG FEMALE GRADUATES IN MALAYSIA. SPECIFICALLY, THIS STUDY EMPLOYED THE THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOUR (TPB) AND OPTED FOR A QUANTITATIVE EXPLORATORY STUDY USING THE CONDUCTIVE METHOD. THE COLLECTED SURVEY SAMPLE OF 227 FEMALE STUDENTS IN MALAYSIA WAS ANALYSED USING PLS-SEM. THE FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF FORMATIVELY AND REFLECTIVELY MEASURED VARIABLES. THE RESULTS INDICATED THAT ATTITUDE, PERCEIVED BEHAVIOURAL CONTROL AND INCLUSIVE INNOVATIVENESS HAVE SIGNIFICANT RELATIONSHIPS TO THE INCLUSIVE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION OF FEMALE GRADUATES IN MALAYSIA.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE STUDY EMPLOYS A THEMATIC ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY, AND THE ANALYSIS IS SENSITIZED BY SOCIAL IDENTITY THEORY AND RELATED CONCEPTS. SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 43 ENTREPRENEURS IN SEVERAL US CITIES. THE WOMEN AND MEN DISCUSSED THE NATURE OF THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL IDENTITIES, AND THE RELATIONSHIP OF PAST INTRA- AND INTERGROUP CONVERSATIONS TO THEIR REALIZATIONS OF A POSITIVELY-DISTINCT ENTREPRENEURIAL IDENTITY. OPEN AND AXIAL CODING OF THE ENTREPRENEURS' VERBAL CONVERSATIONAL CONTENT WAS CONDUCTED. FINDINGS: THE ANALYSES REVEALED FOUR THEMES (AND NINE ACCOMPANYING SUB-THEMES) THAT REPRESENTED DIMENSIONS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL SOCIAL IDENTITY THAT WERE RELATED TO POSITIVE GROUP DISTINCTIVENESS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: FINDINGS MAY PROVE USEFUL FOR MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING AMONG CURRENT AND ASPIRING ENTREPRENEURS, AND FOR EDUCATORS AND MANAGERS WITH AN INTEREST IN ENCOURAGING ENTREPRENEURIAL MINDSETS THROUGH TRAINING PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS STUDY IS UNIQUE NOT ONLY IN ITS ADOPTION OF AN INTERGROUP COMPARISON APPROACH TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP THAT INTEGRATES RECALLED PAST COMMUNICATION, BUT ALSO IN ITS FOCUS ON POSITIVE IN-GROUP DISTINCTIVENESS.

THE CREATION AND DEVELOPMENT OF ACTIVITIES, PROJECTS, AND COMPANIES AWARE OF THEIR IMPACT ON THE PLANET IN THE SHORT, MEDIUM, AND LONG TERM, GENERATE MUCH MORE VALUE WHEN THIS LEADERSHIP COMES FROM A FEMALE ENTREPRENEURIAL VOCATION, BY ENRICHING AND OPTIMIZING THE VALUE OF DIVERSITY IN THE MANAGEMENT OF RESOURCES, TRADITIONALLY DIRECTED BY THE MALE ECOSYSTEM. METHODOLOGY: A METHODOLOGICAL TRIANGULATION IS APPLIED THROUGH IN-DEPTH INTERVIEWS WITH INTERNATIONAL KEY INFORMANTS, ANALYSIS OF DIGITAL CONTENTS IN THE REGIONS OF ANDALUSIA (SPAIN) AND AVEIRO (PORTUGAL), AND THE REVIEW OF PREVIOUS SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE. RESULTS: THE NEW SPANISH-PORTUGUESE STARTUPS ARE STILL MOSTLY LED BY MEN, WHILE THE SHARE OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURIAL LEADERSHIP REPRESENTS 26.5% OF THE TOTAL SAMPLE. DISCUSSION: ALTHOUGH THERE IS A WIDE RANGE FOR IMPROVEMENT IN PRESENCE AND COMMUNICATION, WOMEN ARE INCREASING THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL AND INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY. IN ANY CASE, CO-RESPONSIBILITY WITH THE COMMUNITY AND CARE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL LEGACY ARE STILL LATENT VALUES FOR PROFESSIONAL DIFFERENTIATION.

THE STUDY SHOWS THAT MARIA WAS DESCRIBED AS AN EMERGING YOUNG FARMER AND AN EMBLEM OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP. HER TRAJECTORY MIRRORED THE INTERSECTION OF THE EARTH, GENDER AND FOOD SECURITY THROUGH HER PORTRAYAL AS A WOMAN WHO ENDURED LIFE TRAGEDIES OF LOSING A CHILD, AND BEING A VICTIM OF GENDER-BASED VIOLENCE IN HER MARRIAGE. SHE DREW INSPIRATION FROM HER MOTHER (VENTURING INTO FARMING WAS LINKED TO HER MOTHER), THE EARTH (FARMING WAS AN OUTLET FOR HEALING FROM HER MARITAL CHALLENGES) AND RELIGION (ATTRIBUTED HER SUCCESS TO GOD AS A MEMBER OF THE BAPTIST CHURCH).

THIS RESEARCH INTENDS TO EXPLORE IN-DEPTH THE MOTIVATING FACTORS OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS, WITH A FOCUS ON ALBANIA. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: THE LITERATURE ON ENTREPRENEURSHIP, GLOBAL TRENDS IN WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP, FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN ALBANIA, AND FEMALE MOTIVATION FACTORS IS STUDIED, AND IT IS THE FOCUS AND IS USED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE PUSH AND PULL MOTIVATION FACTORS OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE METHODOLOGY USED IN THIS STUDY CONSISTS OF QUANTITATIVE METHODS. BASED ON THE LITERATURE REVIEW IN OUR UNDERSTANDING, A QUESTIONNAIRE WAS SET UP AND WAS CARRIED OUT TO COLLECT THE DATA. IT INCLUDED SEVERAL FROM THE FIVE-POINT LIKERT SCALE. THE POPULATION OF THE STUDY CONSISTED OF A FINAL SAMPLE OF 494 FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS, FROM DIFFERENT ALBANIAN CITIES. THE HYPOTHESIS WAS DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THE RESEARCH QUESTION. REGRESSION ANALYSIS IS USED TO EMPIRICALLY EVALUATE THE HYPOTHESIS USING SPSS, VERSION 23. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS OF THE STUDY, SHOW THAT BEING INDEPENDENT, WORKING ON SCARCE JOBS, AND WORKING FROM HOME ARE THE MAIN MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS THAT POSITIVELY CORRELATE WITH WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS' PERFORMANCE. AT THE COUNTRY LEVEL, WE FIND EVIDENCE THAT MOTIVATIONAL FACTORS ENCOURAGE FEMALES TO RUN THEIR BUSINESSES, PROMOTING DEVELOPMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. THE CONCLUSIONS ARE WELL SUPPORTED BY THE DATA. FEMALES ARE MORE INCLINED TO START AND GO ON THEIR BUSINESSES. IT IS THE BEST WAY TO BE INDEPENDENT, TO HAVE A JOB ON A SCARCE TIME, AND TO WORK FROM HOME. RESEARCH, PRACTICAL & SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS - THE PAPER GIVES SOME NOVEL INSIGHTS INTO THE MOTIVATION FACTORS AND HELPS TO FILL THE GAP IN THE LITERATURE ON THIS TOPIC. IT WILL SERVE AS A MODEL FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS IN DEVELOPING AND LESS DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. IT WILL BE FULL OF INTEREST AND USEFUL TO FEMALES, BUSINESS COMMUNITIES, ACADEMICS, AND POLICYMAKERS. FROM AN ACADEMIC PERSPECTIVE, THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATED THAT FACTORS INFLUENCING MOTIVATION PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN ENCOURAGING WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS.

WE RECRUITED 56 16-YEAR-OLD MALAYSIAN FEMALE STUDENTS FROM ONE URBAN (N = 24) AND TWO RURAL SCHOOLS IN MALAYSIA (N = 32). A MIXED-DESIGN APPROACH WAS UTILISED BY (1) QUANTITATIVELY ASSESSING THEIR ASPIRATIONS FROM DRAWINGS OF FUTURE SELVES AND (2) QUALITATIVELY COMPLEMENTING THE DRAWINGS WITH SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS (N = 28, 14/14). RESULTS SHOWED THAT YOUTH ASPIRATIONS ARE SOCIALLY PRODUCED, PRIMARILY BY FAMILY MEMBERS BUT ALSO BY INTERNAL FACTORS (E.G., DOMAIN PASSION AND SELF-EFFICACY). WHILE THERE WERE SIMILAR RURAL-URBAN ASPIRATION LEVELS, RURAL YOUTH DEMONSTRATED MORE SELF-BLAMING TENDENCIES (RESULTING IN THEM CHOOSING CAREERS OF LOWER OCCUPATIONAL PRESTIGE) AND FREQUENTLY MENTIONED RESORTING TO PART-TIME ENTREPRENEURSHIP TO SUPPLEMENT EMPLOYMENT THEIR INCOME.

ANALYZE THE OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES FACED BY SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURS, ESPECIALLY IN AN EMERGING ECONOMY; AND 4. ASSESS THE FEASIBLE OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO UPSCALING AND EXPANSION. CASE OVERVIEW/SYNOPSIS: YAMUNA SASTRY, A YOUNG WOMAN FROM A TRADITIONAL INDIAN FAMILY, HAD SET OUT TO ACHIEVE HER DREAM OF FINANCIAL INCLUSIVITY BY HELPING THE UNDERPRIVILEGED IN HER COUNTRY GAIN FINANCIAL INDEPENDENCE AND CREDIBILITY. WHEN SHE WAS APPROACHED BY A CAB DRIVER TO FILE TAX RETURNS FOR HIM, A NEW VENTURE TOOK SHAPE IN HER MIND, AND ALONG WITH A PARTNER, CABDOST, A SOCIALLY DRIVEN FINANCIAL ADVISORY START-UP WAS CREATED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL ADVISORY SERVICES EXCLUSIVELY FOR CAB DRIVERS. CABDOST HAD BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN MAKING OVER 15,000 CAB DRIVERS FINANCIALLY LITERATE, INSTILLING IN THEM A CULTURE OF COMPLIANCE, GETTING THEM TAX REFUNDS AND ENABLING THE INDIAN GOVERNMENT RECOVER EIGHT CRORES IN TAXES. THE SUCCESS OF FINANCIAL INCLUSIVITY AMONG CAB DRIVERS INSPIRED CABDOST TO EXTEND ITS FINANCIAL SERVICES TO TRUCK DRIVERS, AUTO DRIVERS, HOUSEKEEPING STAFF AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL WORKFORCE. THE COMPANY FOUND IT CHALLENGING TO ADDRESS THE DEMANDS OF THE INCREASING CUSTOMER BASE WITH ITS AVAILABLE TECHNICAL RESOURCES. THE ABSENCE OF AN IN-HOUSE TECH TEAM AND THE NEED FOR AN ALL-IN-ONE TECH PLATFORM TO PROVIDE A WIDE VARIETY OF FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUCED CABDOST TO EXPLORE OTHER OPTIONS. DVARA MONEY, A NEO BANK OFFERING FINANCIAL SERVICES, APPROACHED CABDOST WITH A MERGER PROPOSAL. THOUGH IT WAS A LUCRATIVE OFFER, THE FOUNDING MEMBERS WERE APPREHENSIVE AS THEY KNEW THAT MOST OF THE MERGERS FAILED BECAUSE OF MYRIAD REASONS. THEY WERE CONTEMPLATING ON THEIR NEXT MOVE AS THEY WERE IN A DILEMMA ABOUT WHETHER TO DEVELOP A TECHNICAL TEAM IN-HOUSE OR TO GO AHEAD WITH THE MERGER.

A SECONDARY OBJECTIVE INVOLVES INVESTIGATING HOW THESE PBFL METHODOLOGIES CAN BE EMPLOYED TO ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION FOR WOMEN. METHODOLOGY: DURING THE FIRST SEMESTER OF 2018, A TOTAL OF 80 STUDENTS ENROLLED IN THE COMMUNICATION SOCIETY CLASS WERE ENGAGED IN A LONGITUDINAL STUDY, INVOLVING BI-WEEKLY ONLINE SURVEYS PRIOR TO THE SEMESTER’S CONCLUSION. THE SURVEY INSTRUMENTS UTILIZED LIKERT-SCALE MEASUREMENTS, WITH A 5-POINT SCORING SYSTEM. THE DATA ACQUIRED WAS SUBSEQUENTLY ANALYZED USING STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING, WHICH FACILITATED THE EXAMINATION OF BOTH THE PRE-AND POST-CHANGE SCORES AND THE STRUCTURAL PROPERTIES OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH OVERALL COURSE SATISFACTION. IN TERMS OF STATISTICAL EVALUATION, THE STUDY EMPLOYED GENERALIZED STRUCTURED COMPONENT ANALYSIS (GSCA), A POWERFUL COMPONENT-BASED SEM TECHNIQUE, THUS ENSURING A ROBUST AND ACADEMICALLY RIGOROUS INTERPRETATION OF THE DATA. FINDINGS: OUR RESEARCH SOUGHT TO UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS OF LEARNERS’ CHARACTERISTICS, SPECIFICALLY INNOVATIVENESS AND RISK-TAKING, ON COURSE SATISFACTION IN PROJECT-BASED FLIPPED LEARNING (PBFL). WE FOUND THAT FEMALE LEARNERS’ INNOVATIVENESS POSITIVELY INFLUENCED THEIR PERCEPTION OF THE PROJECT’S ENTERTAINMENT AND EDUCATIONAL VALUE, WHICH IN TURN INCREASED PREFERENCE FOR PBFL AND COURSE SATISFACTION. INTERESTINGLY, RISK-TAKING DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE PERCEIVED PROJECT VALUE, WHICH PROVIDES INSIGHTS INTO THE ROLE OF PERSONALITY TRAITS IN LEARNING OUTCOMES. IMPLICATIONS: OUR STUDY INVIGORATES ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION THEORY BY HIGHLIGHTING THE KEY ROLE OF LEARNER INNOVATIVENESS IN PBFL COURSE SATISFACTION, URGING A NUANCED EXAMINATION OF PERSONALITY TRAITS IN EDUCATIONAL CONTEXTS. FURTHER, WE QUESTION THE ESTABLISHED IMPORTANCE OF RISK-TAKING, NECESSITATING A CRITICAL REASSESSMENT IN THIS DOMAIN. THESE PIVOTAL THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS CHALLENGE PREVAILING ASSUMPTIONS, ENRICH SCHOLARLY DISCOURSE, AND OPEN NEW AVENUES FOR RESEARCH. ON THE PRACTICAL SIDE, OUR FINDINGS EMPHASIZE THE IMPERATIVE OF FOSTERING INNOVATIVENESS IN WOMEN’S ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION. THESE INSIGHTS UNDERSCORE THE NEED FOR A STRATEGICALLY TAILORED, CREATIVE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT, WITH THE POTENTIAL TO ENHANCE LEARNER ENGAGEMENT AND SATISFACTION SIGNIFICANTLY. IN SUM, OUR RESEARCH GENERATES TRANSFORMATIVE THEORETICAL INSIGHTS AND PROVIDES ACTIONABLE STRATEGIES FOR IMPROVING THE PRACTICE OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION. ORIGINALITY AND VALUE: OUR RESEARCH PRESENTS A NOVEL APPROACH TO FOSTERING WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN THE MEDIA SECTOR THROUGH PBFL. THIS UNIQUE FOCUS ON THE INTERSECTION OF GENDER, MEDIA ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND PBFL DISTINGUISHES OUR STUDY FROM EXISTING LITERATURE. FURTHERMORE, OUR FINDINGS OFFER EDUCATORS INVALUABLE GUIDANCE FOR ENHANCING FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, THEREBY ENRICHING THE PEDAGOGICAL LANDSCAPE OF THIS DOMAIN. © 2023, COGNITIONE FOUNDATION FOR THE DISSEMINATION OF KNOWLEDGE AND SCIENCE.

IT IS GENERALLY ASSUMED THAT ENTREPRENEURS WITH OPPORTUNITY MOTIVATION HAVE BETTER PERFORMANCE WHEN COMPARED TO NECESSITY ENTREPRENEURS. THIS STUDY AIMS TO TEST THESE SUPPOSITIONS THROUGH THE LENS OF THE ENTREPRENEUR’S MOTIVATION TO LEARN (MTL) AND LEVEL OF FEMALE ENTREPRENEURIAL COMPETENCIES (FECS), NAMELY, BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT, ENTREPRENEURIAL, HUMAN RELATIONS (HR) AND PERSONAL. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: DATA COLLECTED FROM 344 RESPONDENTS THROUGH A SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS ANALYZED USING THE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING – PARTIAL LEAST SQUARES METHOD USING SMARTPLS 4. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE NEED OF RECOGNIZING THE DIFFERENTIALS BETWEEN NECESSITY AND OPPORTUNITY ENTREPRENEURS AS THEY WERE FOUND TO INFLUENCE PERFORMANCE AND LEARNING OUTCOMES. OPPORTUNITY ENTREPRENEURSHIP WAS FOUND TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT BOTH MTL AND THE FECS. THE AUTHORS ALSO OBSERVED THAT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT SKILLS ALONG WITH HR COMPETENCIES PLAYED A GREATER ROLE IN THE FIRM PERFORMANCE. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE FINDINGS DEMONSTRATE A CASE FOR SPECIALIZED, TAILOR-MADE POLICY APPROACHES RATHER THAN THE “ONE SIZE FITS ALL” APPROACH AS EVIDENT IN MANY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. AS NECESSITY ENTREPRENEURS FORM A VITAL PART OF THE INDIAN ENTREPRENEURIAL ECOSYSTEM, APART FROM MENTORING, NEED-BASED COMPETENCY DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS MAY BE LOOKED AT.

THE CASE STARTS WITH A BRIEF LOOK INTO PERKINS’ BACKGROUND AND DOCUMENTS HER ENTREPRENEURIAL SPIRIT, WHICH, AT THE AGE OF 19, LED HER TO IDENTIFY A HITHERTO UNSERVED MARKET (YEARBOOKS) IN THE GRAPHIC DESIGN INDUSTRY AND OFFER AN ONLINE DESIGN SYSTEM THROUGH HER VENTURE, FUSION BOOKS (FUSION). FUSION WAS COMPLETELY BOOTSTRAPPED AND BECAME A RUNAWAY SUCCESS WITHIN FIVE YEARS. THAT ENCOURAGED HER TO ENVISION SETTING UP A ONE-STOP-SHOP DESIGN SITE THAT WOULD MAKE DESIGN ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE. HOWEVER, WHEN SHE TRIED TO RAISE FUNDS, PERKINS ENCOUNTERED MULTIPLE REJECTIONS FROM VENTURE CAPITALISTS. SHE PERSEVERED AND CONTINUALLY REFINED HER STRATEGY. EVENTUALLY, SHE MANAGED TO RAISE VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING AND ESTABLISH HER DESIGN STARTUP, CANVA, IN 2013. CANVA THEN WENT ON TO DISRUPT THE GRAPHIC DESIGN INDUSTRY. THE CASE DESCRIBES IN DETAIL THE REASONS FOR CANVA’S SUCCESS, WHICH WENT ON TO BE ONE OF THE FEW PROFITABLE UNICORN START-UPS. THE CASE ALSO THROWS LIGHT ON HOW PERKINS USED CANVA AS A TOOL TO CHANGE SOCIETY WITH HER TWO-STEP PLAN.

HOWEVER, STEM-FOCUSED ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGED BY DIVERSITY, EQUITY, AND INCLUSION ISSUES, WITH LIMITED RESEARCH EXAMINING WOMEN STEM FACULTY’S PERSPECTIVES IN REGARD WITH EEPS. WE ARGUE THAT TO DEVELOP EEPS THAT ARE INCLUSIVE TO WOMEN, ONE OF THE FOREMOST NEEDS IS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THEIR INTENTIONS BEHIND ENGAGEMENT IN EEPS. THE PURPOSE OF THIS QUALITATIVE STUDY IS TO INVESTIGATE WOMEN STEM FACULTY’S INTENTIONS TO ENGAGE IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION PROGRAMS. IN-DEPTH, SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED WITH 32 SELF-IDENTIFIED WOMEN STEM FACULTY WHO HAVE (N = 13), AND HAVE NOT PARTICIPATED (N = 19) IN EEPS. THE PARTICIPANTS REPRESENTED DIFFERENT STEM FIELDS AND WERE SITUATED ACROSS MULTIPLE INSTITUTIONS IN THE USA. FIVE CORE THEMES EMERGED FROM ANALYZING THE QUALITATIVE INTERVIEWS USING FIRST AND SECOND CYCLE CODING METHODS. THESE THEMES IDENTIFY DIFFERENT INTENTIONS BEHIND WOMEN STEM FACULTY’S ENGAGEMENT IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP PROGRAMMING—TRANSLATION INTENT, INNOVATION INTENT, INTENT TO ENGAGE STUDENTS, PERSONAL INTENT, AND ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENT. OVERALL, THE FINDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE SINGULAR “VENTURE-CREATION” FOCUS IN EEPS DOES NOT SUFFICIENTLY CAPTURE THE VARIED INTENTIONS THAT INFORM WOMEN STEM FACULTY’S ENGAGEMENT IN EEPS.

ECON.,"THE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION IS OF GREAT IMPORTANCE AS AN IMMEDIATE ANTECEDENT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP, UNDERSTOOD AS A KEY TO EXPLAIN FUTURE REGIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN EMERGING COUNTRIES. THERE IS A GROWING INTEREST FROM ACADEMIA ABOUT THE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS FROM EMERGING COUNTRIES. THIS STUDY ADDRESSES, IN AN EXPLORATORY WAY, THE COMBINED EFFECT OF THREE INTERNAL VARIABLES AFFECTED BY THE ENVIRONMENT (PERCEIVED INSECURITY, CORRUPTION PERCEPTION, AND SUBJECTIVE NORM) AND TWO SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC VARIABLES (HOUSEHOLD INCOME AND GENDER) AND THEIR IMPACT ON THE ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION OF UNIVERSITY STUDENTS. A SAMPLE OF STUDENTS (N = 380; MALE = 185; FEMALE = 195) FROM THE TECHNOLOGICAL UNIVERSITY OF THE STATE OF ZACATECAS (MEXICO) IS USED AND A CAUSAL MODEL IS PROPOSED FOLLOWING THE FSQCA CONFIGURATIONAL METHODOLOGY. THIS STUDY HIGHLIGHTS THE GENDER GAP THAT AFFECTS WOMEN EVEN IN THE STAGE THAT PRECEDES THE ACT OF ENTREPRENEURSHIP AS WELL AS THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING FINANCIAL RESOURCES. ALSO, THE RESULTS SHOW HOW CITIZEN SECURITY FACILITATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION AND THE NEED OF IMPROVING THE FORMAL PROCEDURES SURROUNDING ENTREPRENEURSHIP TO REDUCE THE FACILITATING EFFECT OF CORRUPTION. FINALLY, THE FINDINGS SUPPORT THE IMPORTANT ROLE OF SUBJECTIVE NORM. FROM A COGNITIVE POINT OF VIEW, A CONFIGURATIONAL APPROACH IS ADDRESSED TO EXPLAIN THE EFFECT ON ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION OF PHENOMENA THAT ARE STRONGLY PREVALENT IN THE LATIN AMERICA AND THE CARIBBEAN REGION, SUCH AS GENDER INEQUALITY, CITIZEN INSECURITY, CORRUPTION, AND POVERTY. © 2023, THE AUTHOR(S).",NA,"P.

SUSTAIN. FOOD SYST.,"RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION IS ESSENTIAL FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND FOR ENSURING GLOBAL FOOD SECURITY. THE CONCEPT OF RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION HAS BEEN WELL STUDIED IN OTHER SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY, BUT HAS YET TO GAIN RECOGNITION IN THE AGRICULTURAL SECTOR. THEREFORE, THIS STUDY EXAMINED RESPONSIBLE PRODUCTION IN THE CONTEXT OF AGRICULTURE AND THE FACTORS AFFECTING RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCTION IN THE DEVELOPING COUNTRY OF PAKISTAN. FACE-TO-FACE INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO COLLECT DATA FROM 196 FARMERS SELECTED USING THE MULTISTAGE RANDOM SAMPLING METHOD. AN INDEPENDENT SAMPLE T-TEST, CHI-SQUARE TEST, AND ORDERED PROBIT MODEL WERE USED TO ANALYZE THE DATA. THE RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCTION INDEX WAS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE CLIMATE CHANGE ADAPTATION, RESOURCE EFFICIENCY, CARBON FOOTPRINTS, AND ECONOMIC RETURNS OF EACH FARM. THE MEAN VALUE OF THE RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCTION INDEX IS 0.69. THE FARMERS WERE DIVIDED INTO LOW-, MODERATE-, AND HIGHLY RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCERS USING CLUSTER ANALYSIS. MORE THAN 36% OF FARMS WERE HIGHLY RESPONSIBLE. THE RESULTS REVEALED THAT WOMEN’S PARTICIPATION IN FARMING ACTIVITIES, EXTENSION SERVICES, THE USE OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, AND FARMER ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION DIMENSIONS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCTION. FARM PRODUCERS USING THE INTERNET FOR AGRICULTURE HAD A 1.4% POINTS HIGHER PROBABILITY OF BELONGING TO THE HIGHLY RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCER CATEGORY COMPARED TO THOSE WHO DID NOT USE THE INTERNET TO OBTAIN AGRICULTURAL INFORMATION. FARMS WITH WOMEN’S PARTICIPATION IN AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITIES WERE 33.5% POINTS MORE LIKELY TO BELONG TO THE HIGHLY RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCER CATEGORY THAN FARMS WHERE ONLY MALES PERFORM AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS. THEREFORE, WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT AND FARMERS’ ENTREPRENEURIAL SKILLS ARE ABSOLUTE NECESSITIES OF RESPONSIBLE FARMING. THIS STUDY PIQUES THE INTERESTS OF STAKEHOLDERS WHILE ALSO ADDING TO THE SCANT BODY OF KNOWLEDGE ON RESPONSIBLE FARM PRODUCTION AROUND THE WORLD. FURTHERMORE, THIS STUDY IS CRITICAL FOR DEVELOPING A ROADMAP FOR LONG-TERM SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. COPYRIGHT © 2023 SHAHBAZ, HAQ, ABBAS, AZADI, BOZ, YU AND WATSON.",NA,"A.

J. ECON. MANAG. STUD.,"PURPOSE: THE PURPOSE OF THE PAPER IS TO EXPLORE GENDER VARIATIONS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INTERNATIONALISATION FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE RESOURCE-BASED VIEW (RBV) OF THE FIRM; IN PARTICULAR, THE PAPER EXPLORES HOW DIFFERENCES IN THE PERSONAL IDIOSYNCRASIES OF BOTH MALES AND FEMALES IN PART ACCOUNT FOR THE VARIATIONS IN EXPORT INTERNATIONALISATION. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE STUDY DRAWS ON EXTANT LITERATURE ON THE CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND INTERNATIONALISATION RESEARCH (E.G. FOREIGN MARKET KNOWLEDGE, FIRM-LEVEL TECHNOLOGY AND FIRM AGE) AS THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK TO EXPLORE THE ISSUE. THE STUDY IS BASED ON 21 MALE AND 17 FEMALE EXPORT ENTREPRENEURS FROM GHANA AND USES A DESCRIPTIVE RESEARCH DESIGN (I.E. FREQUENCIES AND CHI-SQUARE TEST) TO ANALYSE THE RESULTS. FINDINGS: THE RESULTS SHOW THAT THE PERCEPTIONS OF MALE AND FEMALE EXPORTERS DIFFER ON KEY INTERNATIONALISATION SUCCESS FACTORS BASED ON EXTANT LITERATURE. IMPLICITLY, WHILST BOTH GROUPS SHARED A SIMILAR DEGREE OF BASIC KNOWLEDGE ON A FEW EXPORT SUCCESS FACTORS, ACROSS MOST OF THE OTHER KEY EXPORT SUCCESS FACTORS, THE MALE COUNTERPARTS DEMONSTRATED A MORE EXPANDED VIEW COMPARED TO THE FEMALES. THE RESULTS SUPPORT THE ASSUMPTION OF THE RBV THEORY APPLIED IN THIS STUDY TO ARGUE THAT TO ACCOUNT PROPERLY FOR THE INTERNATIONALISATION OUTCOMES OF SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ENTERPRISES (SMES), THE PERSONALITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE OWNER ENTREPRENEURS ARE CRITICAL RESOURCES WHICH CANNOT BE IGNORED. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: IN TERMS OF LIMITATION, THE STUDY IS EXPLORATORY STUDY BASED ON NON-PROBABILITY SAMPLING METHODS USING DESCRIPTIVE FREQUENCIES TABLES AND ANALYSIS OF CHI-SQUARE TEST AND SO READERS MUST BEAR THIS LIMITATION IN MIND IN INTERPRETING THE RESULTS TO IMPROVE ON FUTURE STUDIES. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THE PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE EMPIRICAL LITERATURE BY OFFERING A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE REGARDING HOW WOMEN AND MEN PERCEIVE AND INTERPRET EXPORT SUCCESS FACTORS AND HOW THAT IMPACTS ON THE INTERNATIONALISATION OUTCOMES OF WOMEN AND MEN.

I EXPLORE HOW INFLUENCERS USE METAPHORS INVOLVING MOTION, SPEED AND ACCELERATION TO DESCRIBE, EXPLAIN AND LEGITIMATE THE VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES AND PHASES OF THEIR CAREER DEVELOPMENT, AND HOW THESE METAPHORS MAY BE VIEWED IN THE WIDER CONTEXT OF SOCIAL ACCELERATION AND CONFLICTING GENDER NORMS. I SHOW THAT THE VALORIZATION OF NEOLIBERAL IDEALS THAT PROMOTE INDIVIDUALITY, FLEXIBILITY, ENTREPRENEURSHIP, AND PASSION AS THE BASIS FOR CAREER CHOICES IS FACILITATED BY THE RAPIDLY CHANGING TECHNOLOGY THAT INFLUENCERS USE.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY'S SAMPLE COMPRISES 391 PARTICIPANTS. THE HYPOTHESES FORMULATED IN THE RESEARCH MODEL WERE TESTED THROUGH STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELLING, USING THE BOOTSTRAPPING METHOD TO PERFORM DECOMPOSITION TESTS AND MULTIGROUP ANALYSES TO ASSESS THE EFFECT OF GENDER ON PERCEIVED DESIRABILITY, PERCEIVED FEASIBILITY AND SOCIAL AND GENERAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. FINDINGS: THE SAMPLE DATA REVEAL THAT WOMEN HAVE A GREATER SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION, AND MEN HAVE A GREATER GENERAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. THE RESULTS REGARDING THE RESEARCH MODEL REVEAL THAT PERCEIVED DESIRABILITY POSITIVELY INFLUENCES SOCIAL AND GENERAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION, WITH STRONGER RELATIONSHIPS FOR MEN THAN FOR WOMEN. HOWEVER, PERCEIVED FEASIBILITY POSITIVELY INFLUENCES OVERALL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION BUT IS INSIGNIFICANT IN EXPLAINING SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION. WHEN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GENDERS ARE ANALYSED, THE PERCEIVED FEASIBILITY BY WOMEN IS SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVELY INFLUENCES THE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION, NOT BEING SIGNIFICANT WHEN MEN ARE CONSIDERED. CONTRARY TO PREVIOUS STUDIES ABOUT HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENTS, MEN HAVE A HIGHER PERCEIVED DESIRABILITY IN BOTH GENERAL AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS, WHILE WOMEN HAVE A STRONGER PERCEIVED FEASIBILITY IN BOTH GENERAL AND SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTIONS. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: THIS PAPER CONTRIBUTES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURSHIP LITERATURE, DEMONSTRATING THAT SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL INTENTION CAN BE INFLUENCED BY GENDER.

RES.,"PURPOSE: PSYCHOLOGICAL AND ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAITS HAVE BEEN WIDELY STUDIED AS EXPLICATIVE VARIABLES OF ENCOURAGING ENTREPRENEURIAL BEHAVIOR, WHILE THEIR IMPACT ON INNOVATIVE ACTIVITY IS LESS EXPLORED. THIS STUDY EXAMINES WHETHER, HOW AND WHY PSYCHO-ENTREPRENEURIAL TRAITS AND SOCIAL NETWORKS EFFECT INNOVATIVENESS AMONG WOMEN FIRM OWNERS. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: ANALYSIS OF DATA COLLECTED FROM 304 SAUDI WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS ACCOMPANIED BY BUSINESS ACCELERATORS PROVIDES A WIDE SUPPORT WITH SOME NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS. WE USE STRUCTURAL EQUATION MODELING TECHNIQUE TO ESTIMATE HOW DIFFERENT CONSTRUCTS INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER AND JOINTLY AFFECT DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY WOMEN'S INNOVATIVENESS BEHAVIOR IN SAUDI ARABIA. FINDINGS: FINDINGS POINT OUT THAT INNOVATIVENESS IS POSITIVELY AND SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE, INTERNAL LOCUS OF CONTROL, ENTREPRENEURIAL ALERTNESS AND ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY. THE CONSTRUCT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL SELF-EFFICACY MEDIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BOTH BUSINESS AND PERSONAL NETWORKS AND INNOVATIVENESS. HOWEVER, PROFESSIONAL FORUMS AND MENTORS HAVE NO SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON INNOVATIVENESS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: THE SAMPLE SELECTION IS LIMITED TO TWO ENTREPRENEURIAL SUPPORT STRUCTURES ESPECIALLY BUSINESS ACCELERATOR AND BUSINESS INCUBATOR. EXPANDING THE CONTEXT TO OTHER SUPPORT STRUCTURES CAN REINFORCE THE IMPLICATIONS AND PROVIDE MORE VALUABLE RESULTS. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: THE FINDINGS ARE LIKELY TO BE OF APPLICABILITY FOR IMPROVING WOMEN ENTREPRENEURSHIP BY ENTREPRENEURIAL SUPPORT STRUCTURES.

THIS PAPER AIMS TO MEASURE AND ESTIMATE THE MOST CRUCIAL SOCIOECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS THAT SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES LEVERAGE TO ADVANCE WOMEN’S BUSINESS INITIATIVES. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: USING A PANEL DATA MODEL WHEREBY THE FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP INDICATOR SCORE SERVES AS THE DEPENDENT VARIABLE AND THE TEN MOST IMPORTANT SOCIOECONOMIC INDICATORS SERVE AS THE INDEPENDENT VARIABLES. TEN SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES ARE ANALYZED USING THE PANEL FIXED EFFECTS APPROACH OF METHOD OF MOMENTS QUANTILE REGRESSION (MM-QR) FROM 1980 TO 2021. FINDINGS: IT HAS BEEN FOUND BY EMPIRICAL PANEL QUANTILE REGRESSION USING THE MM-QR METHOD THAT THE FOLLOWING INDICATORS POSITIVELY AFFECT FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN SOUTHEAST ASIAN COUNTRIES: THE ASSETS INDICATOR, THE PAY INDICATOR, THE WORKPLACE INDICATOR, THE MOBILITY INDICATOR AND THE A WOMAN CAN SIGN A CONTRACT IN THE SAME WAY AS A MAN INDICATOR. BUT THE PARENTHOOD INDICATOR, THE UNEMPLOYMENT INDICATOR, THE SCHOOL ENROLLMENT INDICATOR, THE MEN AND WOMEN HAVE EQUAL OWNERSHIP RIGHTS TO IMMOVABLE PROPERTY INDICATOR AND THE MARRIAGE INDICATOR ALL HAVE NEGATIVE EFFECTS.

CASE OVERVIEW/SYNOPSIS: THE CASE DESCRIBES THE JOURNEY OF A GRASSROOTS-BASED RURAL WOMEN ENTREPRENEUR, PABIBBEN, WHO HAD CREATED AN ARTISAN'S ENTERPRISE AND RURAL BUSINESS MODEL BASED ON GANDHIAN PHILOSOPHIES. THE CASE FOCUSES ON WHETHER GANDHIAN PHILOSOPHIES ARE STILL RELEVANT IN TODAY'S TIME FOR BUSINESS GROWTH. THE CASE APPEALS TO THE ACADEMIC FRATERNITY, BUDDING ENTREPRENEURS, SOCIAL SECTOR START-UPS AND PRACTITIONERS WHO BELIEVE IN THE INCLUSIVE AND HOLISTIC GROWTH OF AN INDIVIDUAL, COMMUNITY, SOCIETY AND THE NATION. THE CASE IS ABOUT THE DILEMMA OF HOW TO GROW A BUSINESS ETHICALLY AND BALANCE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL GAIN. PABIBEN USED GANDHIAN PHILOSOPHIES AS A SET OF VALUES TO MAKE DECISIONS AND SET POLICIES FOR HER BUSINESS. PABIBEN WANTED TO GROW HER BUSINESS AND EXPAND HER E-COMMERCE PORTAL “PABIBEN.COM” FOR OTHER ARTISANS TO DISPLAY, PROMOTE AND SELL THEIR PRODUCTS TO THE GLOBAL COMMUNITIES. SHE HAD TO DECIDE ON THE FOLLOWING: 1. SHOULD SHE SELL OTHER ARTISANS' PRODUCTS UNDER “PABIBEN.COM”? 2. SHOULD SHE ALLOW OTHER ARTISANS TO CREATE THEIR OWN IDENTITY ON THE PORTAL AND HELP THE ARTISANS' COMMUNITY GROW? 3.

J. GENDER ENTREPRENEURSHIP,"PURPOSE: THIS STUDY AIMS TO EXPLORE GENDER PERFORMANCE IN ENTREPRENEURIAL PITCHING. UNDERSTANDING PITCHING AS A SOCIAL PRACTICE, THE AUTHORS ARGUE THAT PITCH CONTENT AND BODY GESTURES CONTAIN GENDER-BASED NORMS AND PRACTICES. THE AUTHORS FOCUS ON EARLY-STAGE VENTURES AND THE HEGEMONIC MASCULINITIES AND FEMININITIES THAT ARE PERFORMED IN ENTREPRENEURIAL PITCHES. THE MAIN RESEARCH QUESTION IS AS FOLLOWS: HOW IS GENDER PERFORMED IN ENTREPRENEURIAL PITCHING? DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THE AUTHORS CARRIED OUT THE STUDY WITH THE POST-STRUCTURALIST FEMINIST APPROACH. THE AUTHORS COLLECTED AND ANALYZED NINE ONLINE PITCHES WITH THE REFLEXIVE THEMATIC METHOD TO DEPICT HEGEMONIC MASCULINITIES AND FEMININITIES PERFORMED AT THE PITCH. FINDINGS: THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT HEROIC AND BREADWINNER MASCULINITIES ARE DOMINANT IN PITCHING. BOTH MALE AND FEMALE FOUNDERS PERFORM HEGEMONIC MASCULINITIES. ENTREPRENEURS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ASSERTIVE BUT EMPATHETIC PEOPLE. FINALLY, THERE ARE CONNECTIONS BETWEEN WHAT ENTREPRENEURS DO AND WHAT INVESTORS ASK, INDICATING THE ITERATION OF GENDER PERFORMANCE AND EXPECTATIONS. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: WHILE THE ONLINE SETTING HELPS THE AUTHORS TO COLLECT DATA DURING THE PANDEMIC, IT LIMITS THE OBSERVATION OF THE PLACE, SPACE AND INTERACTIONS BETWEEN THE JUDGES/INVESTORS AND THE ENTREPRENEURS. AS A RESULT, THE LINGUISTIC AND GESTURE COMMUNICATION OF THE INVESTORS IN THE PITCH WAS NOT DISCUSSED IN FULL-LENGTH IN THIS PAPER. ALSO, AS THE AUTHORS OBSERVED, PEOPLE WOULD COME TO THE PITCH KNOWING WHAT THEY SHOULD PERFORM AND HOW THEY SHOULD INTERACT. THEREFORE, THE PREPARATION OF THE PITCH AS A STUDY CONTEXT COULD PROVIDE RICH DETAILS ON HOW GENDER NORMS AND STEREOTYPES INFLUENCE PEOPLE'S INTERACTIONS AND THEIR ENTREPRENEURIAL IDENTITY. LASTLY, THE STUDY HAS A METHODOLOGICAL LIMITATION. THE AUTHORS DID NOT INCLUDE ASPECTS OF SPACE IN THE ANALYSIS. IT IS MAINLY DUE TO THE VARIETY OF SETTINGS THAT THE PITCHING SESSIONS THAT THE DATA SET HAD. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: FOR SOCIAL PRACTICES AND POLICIES, THE RESULTS INDICATE BARRIERS TO FINANCE FOR WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS ARE REWARDED WHEN THEY PERFORM ENTREPRENEURIAL HEGEMONIC MASCULINITIES WITH A TOUCH OF EMPHASIZED FEMININITIES. EVENTUALLY, IF WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS DO NOT PERFORM CORRECTLY AS INVESTORS EXPECT THEM TO, THEY WILL FACE BARRIERS TO ACQUIRING FINANCE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE HOW CERTAIN GENDERED BIASES MIGHT BE (RE)CONSTRUCTED AND (RE)PRODUCED THROUGH ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITIES, IN WHICH PITCHING IS ONE OF THEM. SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: PRACTITIONERS COULD UTILIZE RESEARCH FINDINGS TO UNDERSTAND HOW GENDER STEREOTYPES EXIST NOT ONLY ON THE PITCH STAGE BUT ALSO BEFORE AND AFTER THE PITCH, SUCH AS THE CHOICE OF BUSINESS IDEA AND PITCH TRAINING. IN OTHER WORDS, IT IS NECESSARY TO CREATE A MORE ENABLING ENVIRONMENT FOR WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS, SUCH AS CUSTOMIZING THE ACCELERATOR PROGRAM SO THAT ALL BUSINESS IDEAS RECEIVE RELEVANT SUPPORT FROM EXPERTS. ON A MACRO LEVEL, THE STUDY HAS SHOWN THAT SEEMINGLY GENDER-EQUAL SOCIETIES DO NOT PRACTICALLY TRANSLATE INTO HIGHER PARTICIPATION OF WOMEN IN ENTREPRENEURSHIP. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: FOR THEORETICAL CONTRIBUTIONS, THE STUDY ENHANCES THE DISCUSSION THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IS GENDERED; WOMEN AND MEN ENTREPRENEURS NEED TO PERFORM CERTAIN HEGEMONIC TRAITS TO BE LEGITIMATED AS FOUNDERS. THE AUTHORS ALSO ADDRESS VARIOUS PITCHING PRACTICES THAT SHAPE PITCH PERFORMANCE BY INCLUDING BOTH TEXTUAL AND SEMIOTIC DATA IN THE STUDY. THIS STUDY PROVIDES SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS ON THE AWARENESS OF GENDERED NORMS AND THE DESIGN OF ENTREPRENEURIAL PITCHING. © 2023, LINH DUONG AND MALIN BRÄNNBACK.",NA,"L.

PROMOTING ENTREPRENEURSHIP INCLUSIVENESS HAS BECOME A CRITICAL STRATEGY TO REVAMP THE ECONOMY. MEANWHILE, THE GLOBAL ECONOMY HAS BEEN PROJECTED TO GROW FASTER WITH AN INCREASE IN WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. HOWEVER, THERE SEEMS TO BE A GENDER GAP AND DIFFERENTIAL IN START-UPS, WHICH DRAWS DOWN WOMEN’S INCLUSION IN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE GENDER DIFFERENTIAL IN ENTREPRENEURIAL INTEREST AND PRACTICE AMONG 12,485 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN NIGERIA. THE RESULTS REVEAL THAT 88% OF MALE AND 84% OF FEMALE STUDENTS WANT TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. BOTH MALES (66%) AND FEMALES (65%) REPORTED HIGH ENTREPRENEURIAL INTEREST, WITH NO STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BOTH GENDERS. THE LOGISTIC REGRESSION ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP EDUCATION, RELATIONAL SUPPORT, RISK-TAKING, SELF-EFFICACY, UNIVERSITY ECOSYSTEM, AND ATTITUDES TOWARD BEHAVIOR ARE THE MAIN DRIVERS OF ENTREPRENEURIAL INTEREST AMONG MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS. HOWEVER, THE UNIVERSITY ECOSYSTEM IS FOUND TO NOT SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT ENTREPRENEURIAL INTEREST AMONG MALE STUDENTS. SIMILARLY, ALL FACTORS EXCEPT FOR THE UNIVERSITY ECOSYSTEM SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURIAL PRACTICE AMONG MALE AND FEMALE STUDENTS. HOWEVER, RELATIONAL SUPPORT IS NOT STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT FOR FEMALE STUDENTS.

DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: THIS STUDY APPLIES THE EMBEDDEDNESS THEORY FOR WOMEN’S EMPOWERMENT THAT PROVIDES A VALUABLE LENS TO EXPLORE THE INTERACTIONS BETWEEN FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS AND THEIR SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND ECONOMIC CONTEXTS. FINDINGS: WITH THIS STUDY, THE AUTHORS FOUND THAT THE NETWORK STRUCTURE WAS USED AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PAST CENTURY IN ITALY AS A USEFUL INSTRUMENT FOR FEMALE EMANCIPATION AND EMPOWERMENT, EXTENDING TO COMMON/NOT EXCEPTIONAL WOMEN ENTREPRENEURIAL OPPORTUNITIES OTHERWISE RESERVED FOR RICH AND NOBLE WOMEN. IN THE INTERPLAY AMONG THE DIFFERENT “CONTEXTS” (POLITICAL, SOCIAL, CULTURAL AND COGNITIVE), IT SEEMS TO EMERGE THE INCIDENCE OF FEMALE SOCIAL RELATIONSHIPS IN FACING AN UNFAVOURABLE POLITICAL AND CULTURAL CONTEXT, BREAKING OUT THE NORMS AND ALLOWING THE BUSINESS TO EXIST AND INFLUENCING, WITH THE ACTIVITY OF THE HIGH SOCIAL STANDING WOMEN, THE COGNITIVE STRUCTURE OF THE OTHER FEMALE WORKERS, MAKE THEM ACTIVE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS ENTREPRENEURIAL ACTIVITY.

THE RESEARCH STUDY IS MAINLY CONCERNED WITH THE FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE EI OF WOMEN. AND ALSO TO COMPREHEND THE CONSTRAINTS AND HURDLES WOMEN FACE TOWARDS STARTING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURE. AZJEN'S THEORY OF PLANNED BEHAVIOR IS BEING EMPLOYED TO COMPREHEND THE EI OF INDIAN MUSLIM WOMEN. THE THEORY CONTAINS THE PERSONAL ATTITUDE, PERCEIVED BEHAVIORAL CONTROL (PBC) AND SUBJECTIVE NORMS (SN). FURTHERMORE, INTENTIONS ARE ALSO DISCUSSED IN THE CONTEXT OF RELIGION. METHODS: A SEMI-STRUCTURED INTERVIEW SCHEDULE WAS CARRIED OUT WHERE A TOTAL OF 7 MUSLIM WOMEN WERE INTERVIEWED IN ORDER TO UNDERSTAND THEIR INTENTIONS AND MOTIVATIONS IN STARTING A BUSINESS. AFTER GATHERING THE DATA, THE DATA WERE ANALYZED BY NVIVO SOFTWARE. THIS PAPER FOCUSED ON THE CODES AND THEMES GENERATED BY THE SOFTWARE. THE VALIDITY OF THE STUDY WAS DETERMINED BY CONTENT ANALYSIS, AUTO-CODING AND PERUSAL OF THE THEMES BY A SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT. FINDINGS: THE FINDINGS PORTRAY THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ROLE OF FAMILY AND SOCIETY IN DECIDING AN ENTREPRENEURIAL VENTURE BY MUSLIM WOMEN. THE INVESTIGATIVE OUTCOMES OF THE STUDY DEPICT THE UNAWARENESS OF GOVERNMENT SCHEMES, LIMITED ROLE MODELS AND LACK OF TRAINING.

THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK: THIS STUDY COMBINES FOUR FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT, NAMELY WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP, EDUCATION, SOCIAL CAPITAL, AND HUMAN CAPITAL, TO FORM A THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK BASED ON EMPOWERMENT THEORY, AND USES THE EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN AS A MEDIATOR TO EXPLORE THE ELEMENTS THAT IMPACT THE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF RURAL TOURISM. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: A MIXED RESEARCH METHOD WAS EMPLOYED, STARTING WITH QUALITATIVE RESEARCH, WHERE 11 RELEVANT INTERVIEWS WERE CONDUCTED TO GAIN A PRELIMINARY UNDERSTANDING OF THE FACTORS AFFECTING WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AND THE SUSTAINABILITY OF RURAL TOURISM. SUBSEQUENTLY, A 68-ITEM SURVEY QUESTIONNAIRE WAS USED IN THE QUANTITATIVE RESEARCH STAGE. A TOTAL OF 340 RESPONSES WERE COLLECTED. THE RELIABILITY OF THE QUESTIONNAIRE WAS TESTED USING CRONBACH'S ALPHA, AND VALIDATION FACTOR ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ASSESS ITS VALIDITY. STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS AND EQUATION MODELING (SEM) TECHNIQUES WERE USED TO TEST THE HYPOTHESES OF THE STUDY. FINDINGS: THE STUDY SHOWS THAT WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP, EDUCATION, HUMAN AND SOCIAL CAPITAL HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AND SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF RURAL TOURISM. WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT MEDIATES THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE FACTORS AND SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT OF RURAL TOURISM, WHICH ALSO POSITIVELY IMPACTS SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITY, ECONOMIC, ENVIRONMENTAL, AND CULTURAL DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE, PROMOTING WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT AND ENHANCING THEIR ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIAL FOR ACHIEVING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH OF RURAL TOURISM AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH, PRACTICAL & SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY PROPOSES A NEW THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK THAT INCLUDES FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, EDUCATION, SOCIAL CAPITAL, AND HUMAN CAPITAL TO FILL THE GAP IN KNOWLEDGE. THE DEVELOPMENT OF WOMEN IN RURAL TOURISM IS ALSO CRUCIAL FOR SOCIETY'S PROGRESS TOWARDS CIVILIZATION, AND POLICIES AND INCENTIVES SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PARTICIPATION AND ENSURE THEIR EFFECTIVE INVOLVEMENT.

THIS PAPER AIMS TO HIGHLIGHT ENTREPRENEURSHIP IN A SPECIFIC TRIBAL CONTEXT AND PROVIDE INSIGHT ON SOME INSTANCES OR CASES RELATING TO WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY INITIATIVES FROM INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS AND GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS TO SUPPORT WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS, ESPECIALLY TRIBAL WOMEN, THEY SUFFER FROM ISOLATION AS A RESULT OF THEIR LANGUAGE AND LIFESTYLE DIFFER FROM THE REST OF SOCIETY, WHICH MADE THE GROWTH OF THEIR BUSINESS AND ABILITY TO COMPETE ARDUOUS, AND THUS AFFECTED THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE VARIOUS DECISIONS IN THEIR LIVES. THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE PATHWAY TO A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF INCREASING ACCESS TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP FOR TRIBAL WOMEN IN MAYURBHANJ DISTRICT, ODISHA. METHODS: THE SAMPLE SIZE WAS 111 SANTHAL TRIBAL WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS, AND ALL OF THEM WERE INTERVIEWED USING AN INTERVIEW SCHEDULE AND FOCUS GROUP DISCUSSIONS (FGDS). TWO ANALYTICAL TOOLS WERE USED (A LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL TO FIND WHICH DEPENDENT VARIABLES INFLUENCE ENTREPRENEURS AND THE WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT INDEX (WEI) TO MEASURE THE PROGRESS IN SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES). THE RESPONDENTS WAS INTERVIEWED AND ASKED ON THE VARIOUS WEI INDICATORS BEFORE AND AFTER AN ENTREPRENEURSHIP INTERVENTION. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: IT WAS OBSERVED THROUGH THE RESULTS THAT THE EMPOWERMENT OF WOMEN HAS CHANGED IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION AFTER ESTABLISHING THEIR WORK; ACCORDING TO THE INDICATORS OF THE STUDY, THE WOMEN'S EMPOWERMENT INDEX HAS CHANGED FROM 0.61 TO 1.26. IT WAS ALSO FOUND THAT ENTREPRENEURSHIP HAS A POSITIVE AND SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON WOMEN'S DECISION-MAKING WITHIN THE FAMILY, AND THEREFORE, IT WAS SUGGESTED THROUGH RESEARCH TO INCREASE THE INTERVENTION FROM THE GOVERNMENT AND RELATED ORGANIZATIONS WITH MORE INITIATIVES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING WOMEN'S EDUCATION AND THEIR FINANCIAL ABILITY TO OPEN NEW ENTERPRISES.

THE CONSERVATION OF RESOURCE THEORY CONVEYS THAT FEMALES AS AN ENTREPRENEUR CAN OBTAIN, RETAIN AND THEN EXTEND RESOURCES FROM THEIR SPOUSES AND FAMILY MEMBERS (HOBFOLL, 1989). HENCE IT IS THEORETICALLY NEEDED TO ENQUIRE ABOUT WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP FROM THE FAMILY AND SPOUSE POINT OF VIEW THEREFORE IT HELPS IN UNDERSTANDING THE DEPTH OF THEIR INFLUENCE ON WOMEN'S BUSINESS PERFORMANCE. METHODOLOGY: THE CONSERVATION OF RESOURCE THEORY WAS USED TO ANALYZE THE INFLUENCE OF SPOUSE AND FAMILY IN THE FEMALE ENTREPRENEUR'S LIFE. TO INSIGHT MORE KNOWLEDGE ABOUT THE STUDY THE ARTICLES PUBLISHED ON THE TOPIC “WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS”, “SPOUSAL INFLUENCE” AND “FAMILY INFLUENCE” WAS SELECTED FROM THE SCOPUS INDEXED JOURNALS, WEB OF SCIENCE, AND GOOGLE SCHOLAR FROM 1990-2022. THE REASON BEHIND SELECTING THE PREVIOUS RESEARCH ON THE TOPIC IS HIGHLY CITED RESEARCH PAPERS ON FEMALE ENTREPRENEURSHIP, SPOUSE, AND FAMILY SUPPORT FOR THEIR BUSINESS. FINDINGS: THIS STUDY EXAMINES THE ROLE PLAYED BY BOTH HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS AND SPOUSES WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE CONSERVATION OF RESOURCE THEORY. HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS ARE THE GOOD RESERVES AND THEY PROVIDE SUPPORT TO BUSINESS-WOMEN, ALTHOUGH A WOMAN NEEDS SUPPORT FROM THEIR SPOUSE. THE FAMILY-WORK DISPUTE ARISES DUE TO BUSINESS WITH HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS BEING OVERCOME EASILY BY WOMEN BECAUSE OF HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING SPOUSE. RESEARCH, PRACTICAL & SOCIAL IMPLICATIONS: THIS STUDY ATTEMPTS TO INVESTIGATE THE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY SPOUSES AND HOUSEHOLD MEMBERS IN WOMEN'S BUSINESSES THROUGH THE USE OF CONSERVATION OF RESOURCE THEORY. MARRIED WOMEN CAN PERFORM THEIR BUSINESS MORE EFFECTIVELY BY OBTAINING THE RESOURCES PROVIDED BY THEIR SPOUSE AND FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE FEMALES AS AN ENTREPRENEUR CAN UTILIZE AND GRASP MAXIMUM RESOURCES FROM THEIR SURROUNDINGS.

RES.,"IN THE INTERSECTION OF INDIGENOUS TOURISM AND GENDER, A PRESSING QUESTION ARISES: HOW CAN INDIGENOUS WOMEN LEAD SUSTAINABILITY AND GENDER EQUALITY IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY? TO SHED LIGHT ON THIS ISSUE, WE CONDUCTED QUALITATIVE AND CASE STUDY RESEARCH IN THE AMAZONIA REGION OF ECUADOR. OUR STUDY ANALYSED THE ROLES THAT NAPO RUNA WOMEN PLAY IN TOURISM DEVELOPMENT, THEIR EFFORTS TO ALIGN TOURISM WITH THEIR SUSTAINABILITY AND GENDER EQUALITY GOALS, AND THE FACTORS THAT SHAPE THESE EFFORTS. OUR FINDINGS HIGHLIGHT THE IMPORTANCE OF FOCUSING ON THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT SURROUND INDIGENOUS WOMEN AND RECOGNIZING THE VARIOUS FORMS OF DISCRIMINATION THEY FACE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT INDIGENOUS PLANNING, LED BY INDIGENOUS WOMEN, IS A CRUCIAL TOOL FOR PROMOTING MORE VISIBLE AND EMPOWERED ROLES FOR INDIGENOUS WOMEN IN THE TOURISM SECTOR. THE CASE STUDY SUPPORTS THE ARGUMENT THAT ADDRESSING GENDER INEQUALITY IS A CRUCIAL FIRST STEP TOWARD SUSTAINABLE BUSINESS PRACTICES, ESPECIALLY IN CASES WHERE WOMEN’S ECONOMIC PARTICIPATION IS INVISIBLE AND INFLUENCED BY VIOLENCE AND GENDER DISCRIMINATION. THIS RESEARCH CONTRIBUTES TO THE WORK OF SCHOLARS AND PRACTITIONERS AIMING TO ADVANCE SUSTAINABILITY AND JUSTICE IN THE TOURISM INDUSTRY. © 2023 INFORMA UK LIMITED, TRADING AS TAYLOR & FRANCIS GROUP. THIS STUDY FOCUSES ON THE IMPACT OF ENTREPRENEURIAL ALERTNESS ON OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION AND THE DISPARITY BETWEEN MALES AND FEMALES IN THE CONTEXT OF INSTITUTIONAL VOIDS. OUR RESEARCH INTEGRATES INSTITUTIONAL THEORY AND ENTREPRENEURIAL ALERTNESS LITERATURE TO ARGUE THAT INSTITUTIONAL VOIDS HELP FACILITATE THE ENTREPRENEURIAL ALERTNESS-OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION RELATIONSHIP – BUT THIS RELATIONSHIP IS DIFFERENT FOR MEN AND WOMEN. THE THEORETICALLY-DERIVED MODEL WAS INVESTIGATED WITH SURVEY DATA FROM 266 ENTREPRENEURS IN GHANA. WE FOUND ENTREPRENEURIAL ALERTNESS POSITIVELY RELATES TO OPPORTUNITY RECOGNITION AND THIS RELATIONSHIP IS MODERATED BY INSTITUTIONAL VOIDS. ALSO, WE FOUND THAT THIS MODERATED RELATIONSHIP IS FURTHER MODERATED BY GENDER SUCH THAT THE RELATIONSHIP SIGNIFIES AN EXCLUSIONARY CONTEXT FOR FEMALE ENTREPRENEURS. THEORETICAL AND PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS ARE DISCUSSED. © 2022 ELSEVIER INC.",JBRED,"V. SANTAFE-TRONCOSO; UNIVERSITY OF CALGARY, CALGARY, CANADA; EMAIL: VERONICA.SANTAFE@USASK.CA J.

FAILURE TO ENGAGE APPROPRIATELY WITH CONTEXT CAN LEAD TO OVERLY SIMPLISTIC INTERPRETATIONS OF RESEARCH FINDINGS. ACCORDINGLY, IN THIS STUDY WE EXPLORE HOW STUDIES ON WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP ENGAGE WITH CONTEXT AND DEMONSTRATE HOW CONTEXT ENGAGEMENT CAN BE ENHANCED BY APPLYING ARTS-BASED LITERARY TECHNIQUES SUCH AS DEFAMILIARIZATION, EXPOSITION, HIGHLIGHTING SUB-TEXTS AND PRIVILEGING THE PROTAGONIST. OUR FINDINGS SHOW THAT CONTEXT IS STILL SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER TREATED IN WOMEN'S ENTREPRENEURSHIP RESEARCH. WE MAKE THREE IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTIONS: WE ENHANCE UNDERSTANDING OF CONTEXT, SYNTHESIZE CURRENT METHODOLOGICAL APPROACHES TO CONTEXT ANALYSIS, AND SIGNPOST SCHOLARS TOWARD SOME EFFECTIVE TECHNIQUES FOR ENHANCING THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH CONTEXT.

RACIAL STUD.,"PERUVIAN IMMIGRANTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ENCOUNTER A COMPLEX CONTEXT OF RECEPTION IN WHICH XENOPHOBIC PORTRAYALS OF LATINXS EXIST ALONGSIDE POSITIVE DISCOURSES ON IMMIGRATION. SIMULTANEOUSLY, THE PERUVIAN GASTRONOMIC BOOM HAS REACHED THE GOLDEN STATE, WHERE FOODIES’ CELEBRATION OF PERUVIAN CUISINE CREATES A FAVOURABLE OPPORTUNITY STRUCTURE FOR PERUVIAN IMMIGRANT ENTREPRENEURS. DRAWING ON ETHNOGRAPHIC FIELDWORK AND LIFE HISTORY INTERVIEWS WITH 35 PERUVIAN WOMEN CULINARY ENTREPRENEURS IN AND AROUND LOS ANGELES, THE ARTICLE ARGUES THAT THESE ENTREPRENEURS CAPITALIZE ON THE POSITIVE FOOD DISCOURSES SURROUNDING PERUVIAN GASTRONOMY TO CONTEST STIGMAS OF AN ASCRIBED LATINX IDENTITY. FOOD BECOMES A POWERFUL WEAPON TO NEGOTIATE A POSITION WITHIN RACIAL/ETHNIC HIERARCHIES. BY SHOWING THAT CULINARY BUSINESSES CONSTITUTE A UNIQUE SPACE WHERE THESE COMPLEX PROCESSES PLAY OUT, THE PAPER EXPANDS THE ECONOMIC FOCUS IN THE ETHNIC ENTREPRENEURSHIP LITERATURE AND PROVIDES KNOWLEDGE ON HOW IMMIGRANTS’ ECONOMIC AGENCY IS EMBEDDED IN BROADER SOCIAL PROCESSES, SUCH AS THEIR SEARCH FOR HOME AND BELONGING. © 2023 THE AUTHOR(S).
